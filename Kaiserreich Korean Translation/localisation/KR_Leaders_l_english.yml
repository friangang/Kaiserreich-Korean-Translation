unit_leader.1.d:0 "In [From.GetHerHis] service to [From.From.GetNameDef], it seems [From.GetRank] [From.GetName] has pushed [From.GetHerselfHimself] too far. As a result of the bad climate in their operational area, the [From.GetRank] has now fallen ill, and will likely need some time to recover. Until [From.GetSheHe] gets well, [From.GetSheHe] will not be performing at [From.GetHerHis] usual level."

unit_leader.2.d:0 "In bringing the battle to a successful conclusion, it seems [From.GetRank] [From.GetName] put [From.GetHerselfHimself] at a bit too much risk while leading [From.GetHerHis] men. [From.GetSheHeCap] has been wounded, and it will likely take some time for the wounds to fully heal, until which time the [From.GetRank] will not be performing at [From.GetHerHis] usual level."

### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_SAUDI_DESC:0 "Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, the mortal rival of many dead men, now turns his sights towards Saud bin Abdulaziz. This rivalry began when the young Ibn Saud was ejected from his tent in Riyadh by the Rashids. Never a pawn of Emirs, ibn Saud's father rallied the destitute men of the coastal Emirates to the great goal of his dynasty, Wahhabism. The Rashids were then ejected at the cost of many men, including their only western ally. Ibn Saud himself started many a feuds the Saudis inherited, as he expressed hatred towards any Arab who turned their nose up towards Bedouins. Ibn Saud overcame this anger, and leveraged his past to negotiate the protection of the western Emirates after Britian left. However, this seed of anger had passed onto his men, who inherited his ferocity and may turn this youthful fury against him yet."

POLITICS_PHILIPPE_PETAIN_DESC:0 "베르됭의 사자는 북아프리카에서 지중해 건너 편의 사악한 생디칼리스트 쥐새끼들에게 거칠게 포효하는 것으로만 보이지만, 그는 조국 프랑스와 그가 가진 모든 것들이 무너지는 광경을 바라보며 가슴이 찢어질 듯한 슬픔에 울부짖었습니다. 그는 자신의 군대가 반란을 일으킬 것이라고는 꿈에도 몰랐고, 에펠 탑에 붉은 깃발이 게양되는 것도 전혀 예상치 못했으며, 자신이 낡은 증기선을 타고 프랑스에서 알제로 탈출하리라는 것도 예상치 못했습니다. 국민 프랑스는 옛 프랑스 공화국의 영광의 그림자에도 미치지 못하지만, 페텡 원수와 그의 조국에 사는 모든 이들의 가슴 속에는 여전히 무언가가 요동치고 있었고, 그것은 그들의 가라앉을 줄 모르는 복수심이었습니다. 베르됭의 사자는 자신의 몸이 북아프리카의 모래가 아닌 프랑스의 땅, 베르됭에 묻히는 것 외에는 바라는 것이 없습니다. 베르됭의 사자는 다시 뛰어들 것입니다. 이번에는 붉은 반역자들을 끝장내기 위해서!"
POLITICS_JEAN_III_DESC:0 "Jean III de Orléans, once the picture of aristocratic aloofness, was severely affected by the syndicalist revolution in France. As he fled to North Africa, he became convinced of the necessity of the monarchy in securing the future of the embattled France and its people. Working closely with Action Française, Jean presented himself as the champion of the people in the fight against syndicalism. With the restoration of the Orléans monarchy, Jean aims to destroy the Communards, and extend the monarchy's principled governance to all France."
POLITICS_NAPOLEON_IV_DESC:0 "Louis Napoleon IV de Bonaparte is the symbol of a France renewed. Coronated in the Notre Dame d'Afrique with the same grandiosity as the first Napoleon in Paris, he represents the ambition of the restoration of France's old glory. Like his ancestor at Austerlitz, Louis Napoleon endeavors to strike a deadly blow to the heart of France's enemies."
POLITICS_PIERRE_FLANDIN_DESC:0 "Pierre Etienne Flandin reminisces of the France that was before the turmoil of the Weltkrieg and revolution. A devotee of laissez faire economics and quite socially conservative, but also firmly republican, Flandin's vision of France's future is equally a vision of the past he so cherishes."
POLITICS_ANDRE_MALLARME_DESC:0 "André Mallarmé is often smeared by his political opponents as foolishly idealistic. Mallarmé embraces such criticisms; indeed, he is an idealist, but to be an idealist, Mallarmé argues, is to subscribe to the most worthy of notions: liberty, equality, and fraternity, the rallying cry of France's first republicans. Mallarmé believes that though syndicalism is an affront to human dignity, the concerns of France's people must be not only tolerated, but considered. A liberal republic, to Mallarmé, is the only effective defence against syndicalism."
POLITICS_FERNAND_BOUISSON_DESC:0 "Fernand Bouisson, a deputy from the 'Bouches du Rhone' before the Weltkrieg and a Pied-Noir, was well suited for the political atmosphere of the exiled French Republic. Bouisson, a leftist with a disdain for syndicalism did not hesitate to publicly disavow that ideology in an address before the chamber of deputies. Bouisson is guided compassion for his fellow man, and the belief that all French should have their needs met."
POLITICS_CHARLES_DEGAULLE_DESC:0 "Charles de Gaulle, who once fought furiously against both the Germans and Communards, now, as president, battles for the fate of the French Republic. A protégé of Philippe Petain, de Gaulle advocates a strong executive as the only institution capable of guiding the wayward Republic back to prominence. As a leader of men, both in the field of battle and in the halls of the legislature, de Gaulle has proven capable."
POLITICS_HENRI_VI_DESC:0 "Henri VI de Orléans, though but a boy when France was swept up in the fires of revolution, still bears a scar on his forearm where a stray piece of shrapnel embedded itself all those years ago. The trials Henri experienced in his youth steeled his resolve to dedicate himself to France; though paternalistic, Henri is deeply personally invested in his people's wellbeing. As king, Henri seeks to be both France's sword and its shield in the struggle for its future."

POLITICS_SAID_TAIMUR_DESC:0 "The Al Said dynasty, which had reaped the benefits of British support in the 19th century, stil yet lives. Folllowing the Peace with Honor in 1921, the young Said bin Taimur accelerated through his political education in Muscat. The former Sultan Taimur bin Feisal had prepared a wise council for his son in 1935 when he abdicated the throne. Said bin Taimur was left with a sense of superiority over the Shia in the Truncial coast and the Ibadi tribesman in Oman proper. More concerning was the new Sultan's attitude towards Dhofaris. Said bin Taimur has taxed them mercilessly, and remained silent to the slave trade that opresses Dhofar."

POLITICS_RAGHIB_DESC:0 "The rival of the Husayni family for decades, Raghib was a student of Istanbul University until the end of the Weltkrieg. Upon returning to Jerusalem, he saw that the Husayni family's aim for an independant Palestine was based on a conflicting promises and antisemitism. Although he himself was Muslim, he believed that the prevailing Palestinian nationalism would be hijacked by a foreign power. Thus, Raghib established his own branch of the Watani party in Jerusalem to counter this movement and the Husayni ambition."
POLITICS_AWNI_DESC:0 "A member of the Al Fatat since before the Great War, Awni assisted in the relief efforts in the Jordan Valley during the Officers Revolt of 1918. While other groups in the Jerusalem Vilyet rallied in the streets, Awni ensured that Yildirim never uncovered the Al Fatat members in Palestine. Now Awni finds himself in control of a vastly unprepared nation that barely knew of his work in the struggle for independence."
POLITICS_MUSA_AL_ALAMI_DESC:0 "Musa Al Alami was the son of the Mayor of Jerusalem, Faidi al-Alami. His upbringing in Jerusalem where Jewish and Muslim converge geve him an appreciation for a government that expedites trade and promotes economic prosperity. The waning power of the Ottomans made his continued allegiance to them impractical to these goals, so in 1926 Musa established Al-tanmiat to prepare cooperation with zionist groups. Non aggression agreements were honoured, and subusquent votes propelled Musa into office."
POLITICS_MUFTI_DESC:0 "The son of Jerusalem's mufti and a mortal enemy of the Nashashibi clan, Amin was always quick to deal. The Husayni family's ongoing anti zionist position was on the decline until Abraham Antebi was arrested by the Turks. Then sentiment began to turn in Amin's favour. Through dealmaking in Syria, Amin was able to provide homes for survivors of the 1918 Officers Revolt. The return of Antebi prooved to be another boon, as the Yildirim that accompanied Antebi began a campaign to destroy all political dissident in Palestine. Arabs in Palestine flocked to Amin, and he continued to make deals on their behalf all the way into office."
POLITICS_ANTEBI_DESC:0 "Albert Antebi spent the first 40 years of his life trying to mediate the Muslim Jewish divide in the Jerusalem Vilyet. When the Jewish Colonisation Association told him to buy land in Jerusalem for Jewish settlements, he always paid the Arab landowners a fair price. His goal of a peaceful creation of Israel was destroyed when he joined Mustafa Kemal in the Caucasus. After nearly dying in an Istanbul prison, Antebi was released as a bargaining chip of the Yildirm Army Group. He was given the ceremonial title of General Governor of Palestine, the first Jew to be honoured by the Ottomans in centuries, and held in Turkish custody as a virtual prisoner."
POLITICS_HILUPAL_DESC:0 "Radwan became General Secretary of the Palestine Arab Workers Society after the Third Internationale voted for and funded it's reestablishment. Before this, the PAWS was in severe danger of bankruptcy in Jerusalem, as the Yildirim had seized their assets following the return of Antebi. Radwan has suggested to the Internationale that the Yildirim would crumble without Antebi if he were to disappear. This became unnecessary as he died along with the Yildirim Officers in the liberation of the Near East."

POLITICS_PIUS_XII_DESC:0 "에우제니오 추기경 파첼리였던 교황 비오 12세는 위대한 영적 열정의 사람입니다. 그는 그의 경건함으로 유명하지만, 사람들을 보호하고자하는 열망 만이 강한 강한 권위주의 조약을 가지고 있습니다."
POLITICS_STEPHEN_X_DESC:0 "엘리야 추기경 달라 코스타였던 교황 스테판 10세는 자선의 본성과 가난한 이들에 대한 사랑으로 온화한 남성 명성을 얻고 있습니다. 대부분은 그가 결국 교황을 국가의 직접 통치로부터 멀어지게 할 것이며, 이미 교황청 내에서 군대가 그 역할을 맡을지를 결정하기 위해 모일 것이라고 추측됩니다."
POLITICS_JOHN_XXIII_DESC:0 "아킬리스 추기경 리나르트였던 교황 요한 23 세는 교황으로서 논란의 여지가 있는 인물입니다. 그는 급진주의자라고 여겨지는 유명한 사회 주의자이며, 사회주의자들의 지지를 받아 북쪽과 화해하게 될 가능성 때문에 교황청에 의해 선택되었을 가능성이 있습니다."
POLITICS_JULIUS_IV_DESC:0 "알프레도 추기경 슈스터였던 교황 율리우스 4 세는 그의 열정으로 유명한 사람입니다. 그는 수 년 동안 로마 교황청의 운영에 관여해왔습니다. 그는 밀라노 대주교를 맡았을 때, 생디칼리즘이 지구에서 박멸 될 때까지 싸워야 할 악이라고 선언했습니다."

POLITICS_POL_REGENCY_DESC:0 "Poland was reestablished by the Central Powers in formerly Russian lands after over a century of foreign rule. Competition between Austria and Germany for influence in Poland, both during and since the Weltkrieg, has left the regency council unable to perform its principle duty, the selection of a new monarch. The, so called, 'eternal regency' lords indecisively over a Poland which remains much the same as it was before the Weltkrieg - poor and restless."
POLITICS_ROMAN_DWOWSKI_DESC:0 "Roman Dmowski was a thorn in the side of Germany throughout the Weltkrieg. While many Polish nationalists embraced the Germans as liberators, Dmowski, wary of Germany's assimilation of Poles in its east, favoured the Entente. His Polish National Committee was recognized by the Entente as the legitimate government of Poland during the Weltkrieg. With German victory, Dmowkski was forced to agitate tactfully and in secret; now as head of state, Dmowski is poised to seek renewed Polish national glory."
POLITICS_WLADYSLAW_SIKORSKI_DESC:0 "Władysław Sikorski led legions of Polish volunteers against the Russian during the Weltkrieg; he proved a capable leader, but with the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Sikorski found himself and Poland betrayed by the very nations that labelled themselves its liberators. Following the war, Sikorski cemented his control of the newly established Polish military, and planned for a day when he could lead Poland into true independence. Now, it seems, that day has come; Sikorski has assumed control of the apparatus of the Polish state, and declared an end to foreign dominance."
POLITICS_POL_SEJM_DESC:0 "The Sejm is the lower house of the parliament of Poland. Historically, the Sejm was an assembly of clergy and nobility which, uniquely, elected the king of Poland. With no current head of state, the Sejm acts collectively as Poland's executive."
POLITICS_FELIKIS_DZIERZYNSKI_DESC:0 "Feliks Dzierzynski, former delegate to the Moscow Soviet, returned to Poland bitter from the defeat of the Bolshevik revolution. Undeterred, however, Dzierzynski, together with other Polish socialists, established a clandestine revolutionary movement in Warsaw which quickly spread throughout Poland. Dzierzynski, as head of state, shepherds Poland for the fulfillment of his socialist ideals."
POLITICS_FRYDERYK_KRYSTIAN_SASKI_DESC:0 "Fryderyk Krystian Saski, born Friedrich Christian von Wettin, king of Saxony, has ascended to the Polish throne. Fryderyk Krystian's status as both king of a constituent state of the German Empire and Poland is alarming to many Poles, who think him subservient to the Kaiser. Subservient or not, Fryderyk Krystian's coronation does indicate increased German influence in Poland."
POLITICS_KAROL_OLBRACHT_HABSBURG_DESC:0 "Karol Olbracht Habsburg-Lothringen, Austrian by birth, is a stalwart advocate of Polish independence. When Emperor Karl plotted to annex Polish lands to Austria, Karol Olbracht advocated fiercely against it. Though amicable to his native Austria, as king of Poland, Karol continues to fight for the Polish people."
POLITICS_MENDOG_III_DESC:0 "Born Karl Gero von Urach, the son of Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, Mindaugas III, Mendog in Polish, ascended to the throne of Lithuania with his father's death in 1929. Though he bears the name of the first king of Lithuania, unifier and folk hero, Mindaugas III is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him, and he to them. Despite this, Mindaugas has now also been crowned king of Poland, ending decades of deadlock in what became known as Poland's 'eternal regency'."
POLITICS_AUGUSTYN_I_CZARTORYSKI_DESC:0 "Augustyn Józef Czartoryski, though not a descendant of any historical Polish monarch, has been enthroned as its new king. The Czartoryski family, ethnically Polish, were influential both in the days of the old Commonwealth and following Russian annexation. With Augustyn, the new Polish nation at last has a truly Polish king."
POLITICS_THE_TSAR_OF_ALL_RUSSIANS_DESC:0 "Poland, just as in the past, is under the control of Russia. Though careful to maintain the facade of independence, Poland is in effect a Russian puppet."
POLITICS_EUSTACHY_SAPIEHA_DESC:0 "Eustachy Sapieha has emerged victorious in Poland's latest elections. Sapieha is a monarchist; though, he has clarified that the monarchy shall only be restored with the consent of Poland's people. Sapieha himself rules much like a monarch; he is paternalistic and supportive of the aristocracy."
POLITICS_MIECZYSLAW_MICHALOWICZ_DESC:0 "Mieczysław Michałowicz, once a socialist, became disillusioned with leftism by the Bolshevik revolution. Michałowicz now champions individual liberty and the free exchange of goods typical of western liberals. Michałowicz has vowed, as president, to preserve Poland's democracy and the freedom of its people."
POLITICS_STANISLAW_WOJCIECHOWSKI_DESC:0 "Stanisław Wojciechowski, a political ally of Alexander Kerensky during the early days of the Russian Provisional Government, has achieved electoral victory in Poland. Wojciechowski, a self-described socialist, shuns the revolutionary ideas of the Communards and other syndicalist movements, and instead advocates liberal democracy with consideration and concern for all."
POLITICS_KAROl_RADEK_DESC:0 "Karol Radek, once the pariah of the Polish socialist movement, rose to prominence by acting as a liaison between Vladimir Lenin and radical German socialist elements. Radek fought alongside Lenin and Dzierzynski in the Russian civil war, and eventually returned with Dzierzynski to Poland, determined to rekindle the flame of socialism. With Dzierzynski's passing, Radek has emerged as his successor."
POLITICS_JAKUB_HANECKI_DESC:0 "Jakub Hanecki was the chief financial minister of the Bolsheviks from Lenin's return to Russia until the bitter defeat of the revolution. He fled the collapsing Soviet Russia under the cover of darkness, bringing with him troves of financial documentation and ledgers linking various foreign socialists to the revolution, and thus saving many from imprisonment or worse. Hanecki, with the death of Dzierzynski, has triumphed over his political rivals. He intends to inject much needed fiscal responsibility into the new socialist Polish government."
POLITICS_ROZA_LUKSEMBURG_DESC:0 "Róża Luksemburg's reputation precedes her; she is considered by many to the ideological progenitor of an entirely new strain of Marxism. Luksemburg, a Leninist, criticized the lack of internal democracy within the old Bolshevik party. She also advocates the necessity of a world socialist revolution; such is the only way, she argues, to secure the revolution at all."
POLITICS_ADAM_DOBOSZYNSKI_DESC:0 "Adam Doboszynski is a moralist, even the by the standards of his party. Doboszynski argues that both Marxism and capitalism destroy the moral fabric of society. The only way, to Doboszynski, to assure the integrity of human beings is to strengthen the morality of society."
POLITICS_TADEUSZ_BIELECKI_DESC:0 "Tadeusz Bielecki, personal secretary to Roman Dmowski, has succeeded his now deceased boss as president of Poland. Bielecki adheres closely to Dmowski's political platform; just like Dmowski, he strives for the return of Poland to geopolitical prominence through both development and the acquisition of new territory."
POLITICS_POL_REGENCY_2_DESC:0 "With the death of the king, Poland is again ruled by a regency council. Wary of a return to the turmoil of the 'eternal regency', Poles anxiously await the coronation of a new monarch."
POLITICS_LUDWIK_PIOTR_I_CZARTORYSKI_DESC:0 "Ludwik Piotr Czartoryski, despite being a child, has directly succeeded his father as king of Poland. A comical image of the young king teething on the ancient crown, which was placed over his too-small head, has not helped assuage concerns that he is as of yet incapable of ruling."

POLITICS_MENDOG_III_PLC_DESC:0 "Born Karl Gero von Urach, the son of Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, Mindaugas III, Mendog in Polish, ascended to the throne of Lithuania with his father's death in 1929. Though he bears the name of the first king of Lithuania, unifier and folk hero, Mindaugas III is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him, and he to them. Despite this, Mindaugas has also been crowned king of Poland, and now a renewed union of his two kingdoms, ending decades of deadlock in what became known as Poland's 'eternal regency'."
POLITICS_ADAM_DOBOSZYNSKI_PLC_DESC:0 "Adam Doboszynski is a moralist, even the by the standards of his party. Doboszynski argues that both Marxism and capitalism destroy the moral fabric of society. The only way, to Doboszynski, to assure the integrity of human beings is to strengthen the morality of society."
POLITICS_FELIKS_DZIERZYNSKI_PLC_DESC:0 "Feliks Dzierzynski, former delegate to the Moscow Soviet, returned to Poland bitter from the defeat of the Bolshevik revolution. Undeterred, however, Dzierzynski, together with other Polish socialists, established a clandestine revolutionary movement in Warsaw which quickly spread throughout Poland. Dzierzynski, as head of state, shepherds Poland-Lithuania for the fulfillment of his socialist ideals."

POLITICS_DUARTE_BRAGANCA_DESC:0 "왕정 복고 이전에 망명 중인 왕족들이 서명한 도버 조약에서 합의한 바대로, 두아르테 2세는 후사가 없던 마누엘 2세로부터 왕위를 물려받았습니다. 1932년 왕위에 오른 뒤, 두아르테 왕은 정부와 그럭저럭 우호적인 관계를 유지하는 한에서 브라질 황실과 캐나다에 망명 중인 영국 왕실과의 유대 관계를 강화하기 위해 노력해 왔습니다."
POLITICS_MARIA_ADLEAIDE_BRAGANCA_DESC:0 "30년 만에 두 번째 여왕의 자리에 오른 마리아 3세는 자신보다 앞선 과제를 회피해 왔습니다. 어린 여왕은 공주였을 때부터 항상 인기있었고, 항상 가능할 때마다 도움이 필요한 사람들을 도와주기 위해 애썼습니다. 그녀의 온화하고 조신한 이미지와는 달리, 그녀는 왕위에 오른 직후 반-통합주의자라는 인식을 무릅쓰고 당의 과도한 활동을 비난해 왔고, 오직 그녀의 두려움 없는 태도만이 그녀의 인기를 돕습니다."
POLITICS_MARIA_PUPPET_DESC:0 "As the recently installed Queen of Portugal and the Algarves, Maria Ana I seems content in her role of doing little actual ruling. Her priority is ensuring the preservation of the Monarchy and in restoring ties with the deposed royal family. Her husband's German nationality, once a liability that essentialy locked her out of inheritance, may very well help in this endeavour"
POLITICS_ALEXANDRE_VIEIRA_DESC:0 "Alexandre Vieira is perhaps Portugal's most prestigious and respected leftist leader, which a marked and distingushed career dating back to the early years of the Republic. After being forced into exile in France after the Integralist takeover in 1926, said respect and former contacts, especially among anarchists and syndicalists, may be key to forming a stable coalition as the dust settles from the fall of the monarchy"
POLITICS_JOSE_CARLOS_RATES_DESC:0 "A veteran in the harsh struggle for Portugal's workers, Jose Carlos Rates entered the political scene in the first years of the republic as a syndicalist leader; however one that strayed far from the anarchist mainstream of Portuguese Syndicalists. Founder of the Portuguese Maximalist Federation, Rates believes in cooperating against imperalism in a wide front, but will likely have issues implementing Totalism in Portugal"
POLITICS_BENTO_ANTONIO_GONCALVES_DESC:0 "Bento is a long time syndical leader, entering the political arena in the waning years of the Weltkrieg as the conditions for Portuguese workers worsened. As syndicalist repression grew, in 1925 he was forced to flee Portugal after a failed strike, which seeked to emulate the English Revolution in Portuguese soil. Now returned after decades of exile, Bento has the daunting task of recovring Portugal ahead of him"
POLITICS_ANTONIO_RESENDE_DESC:0 "A staunch republican, Antonio was agressive in its attacks against the restoration in 1922, which forced him into exile after he alledgedly advocated for regicide, an accusation he to this day claims to be false. Exile has not been kind to public memory of the Porto politician, but no leadership arose in the PRED that can claim his ideological intensity or credibility, even as he is thankful for those who kept the flame of Republicanism alive in these dark years"
POLITICS_AFONSO_COSTA_DESC:0 "A leading figure in the First Republic, Afonso Costa has been long been deeply involed with the republican cause in Portugal, and he was one of the architects of that first revolution. The last leader of the former Republic, his prestige was kept intact even after decades of exile in multiple countries, and there is hope that this republic learns from the mistakes of the past. However, the man's advanced age and illing health may very well put said plans in jeorpardy"
POLITICS_ANTONIO_GRANJO_DESC:0 "Antonio's current leadership of Portuguese Liberal Republicans very well stems for his actions, for he was one of the few who actively attempted to stop the Restoration by taking up arms and urging others to do the same. The years in exile have not been kind to the politician, whose sexagenarian appearance may very well be unfamiliar to those used to the image of the man who attempted to defend the Republic."
POLITICS_JOAO_CANTO_CASTRO_DESC:0 "The aging admiral's beliefs may seem paradoxical to foreigners, as he has far more in common with monarchists than republicans in Portugal's political areana. However, as he is once again deemed the only man fit to leader, he will try his utmost to be a competent captain of Portugal for one last time, and endeavour to crush those who wish to end Portugal as a nation from whithin such as Iberists and Integralists"

POLITICS_OSMAN_ALI_KHAN_DESC:0 "Prince Osman Ali Khan, once but a subject of the mighty British Empire, united the southern Princely States in the chaos following the dissolution of the British Raj. Under his leadership, the fledgling Princely Federation routed socialist invaders and internal fifth-columnists alike, and thus prevented a Dominionist attack. As the Federation has matured, however, difficulties have arisen regarding the very nature of the nation's government. Osman Ali Khan must now guide the Federation from the deadly grasp of its many encumbrances and into a more stable tomorrow."
POLITICS_KRISHNA_WADIYAR_IV_DESC:0 "Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, Prince of Mysore, is a scholar at heart. Renowned for his great collections of music and literature, and singular amongst Indian lords for his patronage of higher-learning, Krishna Raja Wadiyar yearns for enlightenment. His vision of an Indian 'city-on-a-hill' however, was nearly dashed with the end of the British Empire and turmoil that followed. Now, as leader of the Princely Federation, he strives to illuminate southern India, and perhaps one day, the entire sub-continent."
POLITICS_JAYACHAMARAJENDRA_WADIYAR_V_DESC:0 "Jayachamarajendra Raja Wadiyar V, Prince of Mysore, has succeeded his erudite uncle to the throne of Mysore, and now, the Princely Federation itself. Jayachamarajendra, much like his uncle, is an academic. Unlike his patron predecessor, however, he is himself a noteworthy artist. Jayachamarajendra seeks to paint all of India, not just the Federation, into a harmonious mosaic incorporating the subcontinent's many peoples and ways of life; through skillful policy, his idealic fantasies may yet be in reach."

POLITICS_CORNELIU_ZELEA_CODREANU_DESC:0 "The Conducător, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, is the undisputed leader of the populist Iron Guard and leader of Romania. A fanatic nationalist, he seeks to unite all lands inhabited by Romanians, from Transylvania to Dobrogea, and throw off the German yoke once and for all."

POLITICS_BORIS_SAVINKOV_DESC:0 "The leader of the extreme nationalist and populist 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii' (People's Republican Party of Russia) and its violent paramilitary organisation known as the 'Combat Squads', Boris Viktorovich Savinkov was originally a leading member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party before commandeering its rightist wing off into the NRPR. A skilled writer and demagogue, Savinkov harbours an intense hatred for the weakness of the left and holds grandiose dreams of restoring Russia to its role as the hegemon of reaction."
POLITICS_DMITRI_ROMANOV_DESC:0 "An influential figure among Russian aristocrats, cousin of the last Russian Emperor Nicholas II, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich finds it very easy to manipulate the Russian political scene. A wide net of relations and acquaintances also helps him when it comes to international relationships. In internal policy, however, his lack of competence is only barely covered by his charm and personality."
POLITICS_DMITRI_ROMANOV_TSAR_DESC:0 "Numerous connections among the nobility, both Russian and foreign, help Emperor Dmitri establish firm diplomatic relations with foreign courts and governments. His excellent grasp of media also gives him an advantage when it comes to establishing a positive popular image. In internal policy, however, his lack of competence is only barely covered by his charm and personality."
POLITICS_PAVEL_II_DESC:0 "Only 12 at the moment of his father's death, young Pavel II is very likely to become a puppet at the hands of the regency council. Still, it is obvious that he inherited at least some of his father's charm - which, if combined with a sufficient political capacity, may some day give him a chance for independent rule."
POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_CON_DESC:0 "Restored by the consensus of all political forces in Russia, Kyril Romanov had to accept many limitations of his powers, enclosed in a renewed constitution. Even though he quickly adapted to the new situation, his old-school outlook on politics and internal relations are more then likely to spark tensions between him and the government."
POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_ABS_DESC:0 "With autocracy restored after two decades of republican rule, emperor Kyril is perhaps the last Romanov to uphold the traditional image of a strong, decisive autocrat. While the Russian people hope for the years of anarchy come to an end, the international arena observes the situation with suspicion, fearing a restored, possibly aggressive tsardom."
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_ROMANOV_CON_DESC:0 "Member of the post-revolutionary generation of the Romanovs, Vladimir has a completely new outlook on the constitutionalism than his father. A tactful and temperate person, he understands that Russia may not survive yet another revolution - and is willing to cooperate with all forces aiming for the well-being of the country."
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_ROMANOV_ABS_DESC:0 "Member of the post-revolutionary generation of the Romanovs, Vladimir has a completely new outlook on the autocracy than his father. A tactful and temperate person, he understands that Russia may not survive yet another revolution - and is willing to cooperate with all forces aiming for the well-being of the country."
POLITICS_PYOTR_WRANGEL_TSAR_DESC:0 "Wrangel's outlook on autocracy in Russia is simple - only with a strong rule one can protect the Empire from foes within and without. Ruthless against his enemies, Wrangel is loved by reactionaries and hated by both liberals and socialists. In international relations some perceive him as a strong man for difficult times - while others fear that one day he may become the new Gendarme of Europe."
POLITICS_ANTON_DENIKIN_DESC:0 "Anton Ivanovich Denikin was one of the more successful of the White generals during the Russian Civil War, besting both Trotsky and Makhno, before eventually capturing Moscow. Seen as a political moderate and a Kerensky loyalist given his supposed republican values and serf background, Denikin's true political motivation is pragmatic patriotism. Even though he supported Kerensky against Kolchak's attempted putsch in 1925, Anton Ivanovich has stated again and again that he will do whatever is necessary to restore and maintain Russian greatness."
POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KERENSKY_DESC:0 "Aleksandr Kerensky is one of the most notorious politicians in Russia, with whom the majority of the Russian population associates such events as the fall of the first Russian Republic, shameful second Brest-Litovsk peace treaty and cowardly foreign policy. However, the Russian economic boom during the NEP programme in 1925-1930, recognition of the land redistribution and recovery of the industry were also made thanks to Kerensky's internal policy. But the large political crisis of 1933-1935 has almost destroyed Kerensky's regime and even though Kerensky is approaching the fifteenth year as President of the Republic, his government barely controls the country. It is unknown if the President and his policy will maintain the order in the country or finally disappear in the past..."

POLITICS_SLOBODAN_JOVANOVIC_DESC:0 "One of Serbia's most prolific jurists, historians, sociologists, journalists and literary critics.

Unprepared for kingship, having previously been far down the order of sucession, he is essentially a puppet of the Siamese Council of State run by his cousins. Educated abroad and commissioned in the British Army, Prajadhipok nonetheless genuinely cares for his people and works diligently to improve his subjects’ lot." # Prajadhipok
POLITICS_RAMA_VIII_DESC:0 "Ananda Mahidol, known by his regnal name Rama VIII, has ascended to the Siamese throne following the death of his uncle, Rama VII. Ananda Mahidol was once considered a very unlikely candidate for the throne, being barely a teenager and of low birth. He originally held the rank of ‘Mom Chao’, making him among the lowest of Siamese princes. Despite his youth and inexperience, he has quickly won the hearts of the Thai people. Foreign observers, however, believe that he did not really want to be king that his reign would not last long. " # Ananda Mahidol
POLITICS_RAMA_VIX_DESC:0 "Bhumibol Adulyadej, known by his regnal name Rama IX has ascended to the Siamese throne following the mysterious death of his late brother, Rama VIII. Bhumibol Adulyadej has so far proven himself much more politically competent than his late brother, navigating the convoluted Siamese political landscape with seeming ease.

While being nominally subservient to British interests, Ali Shire's support of Abdullah Hassan, the Mad Mullah, was crucial in defeating Italy in Afrika during the Weltkrieg.

Even in defeat, however, Hertzog continued to champion the Afrikaner people. He rose to leadership of the Afrikaner dominated 'National Party', and in 1924, became South Africa's first Afrikaner prime minister. With the collapse of the United Kingdom the following year, Hertzog declared the independence of South Africa and seized the British colonies of Bechuanaland and South Rhodesia. Hertzog, as president of the new South African Republic, has been a proponent of segregation between South Africa's various racial groups, and has encouraged the disenfranchisement and resettlement of South Africa's already oppressed black population."

His second reign has been even more tumultuous than his first; republican, Carlist, and socialist dissidents all undermine his authority, and economic growth has stagnated. Spain, under Alphonso, has become a powder keg liable to explode."

After living half of his life abroad in the west, Antoun returned to his homeland in 1925 to find the dream of democratic Lebanon dead. In Lebanons's rubble, Antoun founded an organisation called Natural Syria, dedicated to a non sectarian independent Syria that could stand against Ottoman and Western Imperialism. Sharing only a distaste for imperialism, Antoun rejected the message of the syndicalists as divisive and rejected the Ba'ath ideals. Antoun sees Natural Syria as the homeland of ally Syrians, Kurds, Iraqis and Lebanese regardless of race. In his writing, Antoun claims that he will merge the best parts of socialism, nationalism, and patriotism under the Zawbaa."
POLITICS_FAWZI_QUWU_DESC:0 "Captain of the 12th Ottoman corps of Mosul, Fawzi had proven his bravery to the Turks. Where many heard the call of Faisal's Arab Revolt, Fawzi heard only the commendations from General Otto von Kreiss. When the Turks were victorious, they made Fawzi a Pasha. Although showered with praise, Fawzi refused to call himself a Pasha. His current role as military governor is unique among the vilayets as he exerts considerable control over the soldiers in his command."
POLITICS_ADIB_BIN_HASSAN_SYR_DESC:0 "Sami Al Hinawi has spent his career avoiding the easy paths to power. Never renouncing his Arab name in the Ottoman Military, his loyalty earned him the right to use his birth name. The allure of the Arab Revolt never reached him in during his time in the Jerusalem Vilyet. A possible alliance between his officers and the emerging SSNP was rejected on the same basis that the easy way to power is a trap. Time will tell whether this stalwart commitment will pay off."
POLITICS_SHUKRI_QUWATILI_DESC:0 "Among the several branches of Al Fatat in the Arab world, none would be as successful as Syria's. This is due to the careful manoeuvring of their leader, Shukri al-Quwatli.

Shukri's position in Syria is an intermediary between the liberal burghers and conservative landowners that hold judicial power in Syria."
POLITICS_SULTAN_ATRASH_DESC:0 "Sultan Atrash is relied upon by the Syrian people not because he is a great unifier.

Atrash wishes to rebuke pan arabism and protect Syria as a nation of minorities."
POLITICS_NAZIK_AL_ABID_DESC:0 "Once exiled to Cairo in the wake of a Turkish crackdown, Nazik al Abid has pulled off an incredible achievement other Arab feminists like Tarab Abdul Hadi could only dream of; for she was elected head of state of Syria.

POLITICS_SABRI_ASALI_DESC:0 "Sabri al-Asali began as an Arab member of the Ottoman Parliment in the capital. Where many of this contemporaries joined secret societites and stocked weapons, Al Asali knew that legeslation would lead to Syria's freedom. When the pen signed Syria's independence, he was in Cairo in Hal'il meeting with heads of state. It is through the outside in that Sabri al-Asali assumed power in Syria. He may be out of touch with the common Syrian, but his commitment to economic ties with the Arab world set Sabri apart from his peers."
POLITICS_SYNDIE_JBS_DESC:0 "A Sheikh is not the first person the International expected when they asked Syria to elect their first leader among the syndicates. While it is true that Muhammad al-Ashmar's first station was a Mufti, he is now a leader of the people. His influence within the mosques in reinterpreting Islamic law and rejecting Secular syndicalism in favor of voluntary Zakat from all sets him apart from any other branch of socialism in Syria."
POLITICS_MICHEAL_AFLAQ_DESC:0 "Michel Aflaq was in Paris during the Syndicalist revolution. Swept up in the socialist organisations, he joined the Commune's government as an informal student. There he studied trade unionism with Saladin al Bitar, and they both decided that Syria was ready for revolution in 1925. The revolution to be, a renaissance or Ba'ath, never materialised. Michel was unable to form trade unions in Damascus or Mosul, so he returned to Paris in 1930 abandoning the Ba'ath party. His return as of late as an emanciaptor and the forced creation of a trade union council in Damsacus means his power is backed up by his superiors in the Internationale more than it is backed by Syrian supporters. This will not stop Aflaq from realizing the dream of Ba'ath however, a united Syrian protletariat."

POLITICS_ALEXANDR_KOLCHAK_DESC:0 "Once a polar explorer and commander in the Imperial Russian Navy, who had also fought in both the Russo-Japanese War and the Weltkrieg, Kolchak had tried to claim himself the 'Supreme Ruler of Russia' but failed to garner enough support. His relations with the newly created Russian Republic's government were quite hostile due to the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, which they had agreed to and signed, and had only worsened in 1925 after Kolchak's unsuccessful coup d'etat against the 'German lapdogs'. The rogue admiral managed to flee Russia and found shelter in the pro-Japanese state of Transamur. Now a puppet of Hirohito, Kolchak is trying to gather enough power and support to overthrow the government in Petrograd and crown himself leader of Russia."
POLITICS_NIKOLAY_SMIRNOV_DESC:0 "A man of science, Smirnov was forced to go into exile due his criticism of the Russian Republic's acceptance of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty. Transamur, which has become his new home, is where Smirnov has managed to involve himself in politics, cementing his position as an influential political leader. His incredible and bountiful wisdom has made him a leading figure within the anti-Kolchak movement. Now, since the rogue admiral is no longer alive and his dictatorial reign has come to an end, Smirnov's wisdom and extraordinary intelligence has helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."
POLITICS_SHUMYATSKY_DESC:0 "Boris Shumyatsky's parents were forced into exile in Siberia because they refused to leave their home. This incident has stuck with Shumyatsky, continually reminding him of the corruption within the Tsarist government based in Petrograd. A former Bolshevik, Shumyatsky was forced to leave Russia upon the conclusion of the Russian Civil War and has become an influential politician within Transamur. Despite his political views shifting towards the right, Shumyatsky continues to pursue the goal of turning Transamur into a welfare state. His past experience as a Bolshevik agitator has helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."
POLITICS_MERKULOV_DESC:0 "A former leader of the pro-Japanese Provisional Primorsk Government, Merkulov's cabinet had been incorporated into Semyonov's Transbaikal state. Now, as Kolchak no longer stands in his way and democracy has finally returned to Vladivostok, Merkulov, a son of a humble peasant, is eager to lead Transamur to prosperity. His vast and personal connections with the people have helped him gain a majority of the votes during the Presidential elections."

Outraged, he ceased all the contact with the government of the Russian Republic, and left for Transamur where he found many supporters. Formerly the right hand man of admiral Kolchak, Sergei betrayed and killed his 'friend'. Less aggressive and ambitious than the rogue admiral, and a hardened veteran, Wojciechowski is now ready to advance West."
POLITICS_SEMYONOV_DESC:0 "An Ataman of the Baikal Cossacks, Semyonov and his boys had managed to establish a Transabaikal state, currently known as Transamur, in order to fight Bolsheviks who had been agitating in the Russian Far East. His newborn country was soon subjugated by Japan. When Kolchak's coup in 1925 had failed and the had rogue admiral had left Russia for Transamur, Semyonov was forced to resign and continue his career as military commander. However the 'father-of-state' has managed to return, politically influential. Semyonov's only goal is to see Transamur prosper and, in order to do so, he is unwilling to wage uncertain wars."

A honourable war hero, he has been granted the ultimate gift from the emperor: to peacefully rule over the lands he'd conquered so many years ago.

POLITICS_ALEXANDRU_VAIDAVOEVOD_DESC:0 "Born to a Greek-Catholic family Voevod was supportive of a plan to federalise the domains of the Habsburgs, and was close to Archduke Franz Ferdinand. In 1906, he joined a group of Romanian nationalists in the Budapest Parliament, becoming an important opponent of the Hungarian government, and fought for Transylvania's right for self-determination. Disappointed by the Austrian cause after Franz Ferdinand's assassination in Sarajevo he turned towards an advocacy of Transylvania's union with Romania."

POLITICS_VASYL_DESC:0 "King Vasyl I von Habsburg-Lothringen is regarded by most ethnic Slavs, Russians and Ukrainians alike, to be a humiliating symbol of foreign dominance. In fact, with political polarisation growing so rapidly in Ukraine, a disdain for King Vasyl is perhaps the only commonality amongst Ukrainians. With such opposition, a stagnant economy, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and most of all, tension with the influential Hetman, Vasyl struggles to maintain authority."
POLITICS_NIKITA_KRUSCHEV_DESC:0 "Nikita Kruschev, authoritarian socialist, has become the premier of Ukraine. Kruschev, born to Russian peasants near the current Russian-Ukrainian border, harbours a deep disdain for the landowning Kulaks; he plans to eliminate the Kulaks as a social class through forced seizure and collectivisation of their land. Such measures, however, are unpopular among all but a small number of Ukrainians, which may force Kruschev to compromise."
POLITICS_LEO_STEFAN_DESC:0 "King Leo Stefan von Habsburg-Lothringen, while ethnically Austrian, has been raised in the Ukrainian culture. While to some, Leo's ascension is indicative of compromise between the Reichspakt and Ukraine, many lament the continued dominance of Ukraine by foreigners. The real compromise, these dissidents claim, was between Germany and Austria, who are now united in support for Leo."
POLITICS_DANIIL_I_DESC:0 "King Daniil Skoropadsky, son of the famous 'Hetman', has ascended to the Ukrainian throne. With the long power-struggle between the Hetman and the monarchy finally resolved, Ukraine breathes a sign of relief. Daniil aims to bring stability and order to Ukraine, and decisively eradicate the Ukrainian socialist movement. While not openly hostile towards Germany, he seeks to assert Ukrainian independence and reorient the Ukrainian economy to serve Ukrainians alone."

POLITICS_ARTHUR_HORNER_DESC:0 "Born in the mining town of Merthyr Tydfil in Southern Wales, the young Arthur Horner was very much a working class lad. As the eldest surviving son of seventeen children, of whom only six lived past infancy, his career began in the mines of Wales, and the idealistic young man came into contact with the mining unions of Southern Wales, becoming a member.\nHe would continue his low-level political activism in Welsh mining unions until the British Revolution of 1925, when the Monarchy was forced out and the Union of Britain was declared by the Trade Union Congress.\n\nDuring the Revolution, Horner was a key organiser of Miner's strikes in Wales and played a large role in guaranteeing the support of Miner's unions of Wales. After the death of the revolutionary leader John Maclean, Horner became involved in the emerging factionalism of the TUC, becoming an important leader of the status quo Federationist faction, favouring the Unions and the status quo established after the 1925 revolution.\n\nHorner's big moment came when Philip Snowden retired from the position of General Secretary of the TUC, and Horner captured and canvassed enough votes to become the new General Secretary of what is the vanguard of Syndicalism in Europe. Socialist Britain stands united under it's General Secretary, for better and worse times to come!"
POLITICS_PHILIP_SNOWDEN_DESC:0 "The mild-mannered Viscount almost shouldn't have been the Chairman of the British Trade Union Congress, yet somehow he is, and he is well liked by the factions of what is a viciously factional body. Snowden's victory is largely credited to his decision to avoid the fractional politics of the Trade Union Congress and how he showed himself to be an unaligned and neutral candidate, free of partiality. Since his assuming of the title of Chairman, Snowden has seen old faces go and new faces come in the TUC, but he has always remained a symbol of British post-revolutionary unity, always calming factional tensions wherever they come, and seeking to maintain a balance between all four factions- which is perhaps why he unopposed Mosley's bid for Exchequer. The former Liberal-turned-Syndicalist is perhaps the most normal figure in these strange times, always staying above and refusing to occupy his time with petty insults. As the 1936 Congress of Trade Unions approaches, Snowden has given many hints to his possible retirement- an uncomfortable reality to say the least."

POLITICS_OSWALD_MOSLEY_DESC:0 "Oswald Mosley, left with a permanent limp from a flying accident during the Weltkrieg, entered into British politics a conservative. By the outbreak of the British Revolution, however, Mosley famously crossed the floor of parliament to stand with the revolutionaries of the Independent Labour Party.\n\nMosley, despite his physical impairment, quickly became perhaps the most passionate orator on the left. His firebrand speeches, particularly his famous address before the conservative workers of Birmingham, propelled Mosley to the forefront of the Trade Union movement, and eventually leadership of the governing TUC.\n\nMosley, founder of the authoritarian Maximist faction of the TUC, is a vocal exponent of increased centralization, and aggressive foreign policy."
POLITICS_NICLAS_GLAIS_DESC:0 "Niclas Y Glais and the poetry, both in English and Welsh, he penned regarding the struggles of the working class, inspired many typically conservative rural laborers to embrace the British Revolution; his Welsh translation of the British anthem “The Red Flag” is sung by Welsh socialists of all stripes.\n\nDespite fierce opposition, Glais advocates both on the floor of the Trade Union Congress, and through his poetry, the devolution of power from the TUC to workers' assemblies in Wales and Scotland. The people of these regions, he argues, are both culturally different from that of England and currently politically underrepresented. With Glais as chairman of the Trade Union Congress, power is likely to be increasingly decentralised."
POLITICS_ANNIE_KENNEY_DESC:0 "Annie Kenney, imprisoned by the old regime of Britain for militant women's suffrage activism, convinced many of the working women of Britain to join the Trade Union movement in the prelude to the British Revolution. Her advocacy massively inflated support for the revolution, and subsequently pressured the new socialist government to grant political rights to women.\n\nOriginally run as candidate for TUC chair by the pacifist Congregationist faction in protest of the TUC's alleged failure to secure equality between men and women, through cooperation with the more orthodox Federationist faction, Kenney has become the first chairwoman of the TUC."
POLITICS_TOM_MANN_DESC:0 "Tom Mann, the famous first General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress, has been appointed as chairman of the TUC following electoral gridlock. Mann, though a Leninist, has shown great historical commitment to the Trade Union movement and a dedicated spirit of civil service. Mann, in his old age, however, has indicated that he does not intend to stand for re-election."
POLITICS_TE_LAWRENCE_DESC:0 "Thomas Edward Lawrence, the famous officer and archaeologist who unsuccessfully led the Arab tribes in rebellion against the Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg, has led a coup against the government of the Union of Britain. Lawrence, charismatic yet reserved, has made ambiguous promises to the British people regarding Britain's future. While his past dedication to the Syndicalist cause is undeniable, many speculate that he harbours monarchist sympathies."
POLITICS_CLEM_ATTLEE_DESC:0 "Clem Attlee, shocked and disgusted by the poverty he witnessed while working at youth charity, became a prominent figure within the Independent Labour Party, and eventually the Trade Union movement. His activism, however, was cut short by the Weltkrieg.\nAttlee served on multiple fronts during war, and was eventually promoted to the rank of major. While Attlee's army service did instil in him a strong work ethic, it only entrenched his opposition to rigid hierarchy.\n\nAttlee, in British politics, is an ally, but not formal member of, the Autonomists."
POLITICS_BARBARA_CASTLE_DESC:0 "Barbara Castle, as a girl of only fifteen, led the children of her secondary girls' school in a rising in support of the British Revolution. The quirky red-haired girl quickly became a cultural icon throughout the newly established Union of Britain.\nAs she grew into a young woman, Castle again came into the public eye as the first female leader of the Oxford Students' Union, and never again left it.

POLITICS_ERIC_BLAIR_DESC:0 "Eric Blair, the famous writer who helped propel his long-time ally Oswald Mosley to political prominence, came gradually to oppose Mosley. At every opportunity, Mosley seemed to tread upon the principles of the Union of Britain and the revolution which created it.\n\nBlair, with political triumph over his old friend, has vowed to restore to the people of Britain the freedoms Mosley so egregiously stripped from them."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_GALLACHER_DESC:0 "William Gallacher founded the Labour Withholding Committee in opposition to the Weltkrieg era Munitions Act. Jailed in his native Glasgow for undermining the war effort, Gallacher became increasingly radicalised. Upon release from prison, Gallacher joined the Glasgow Trades Council, part of the greater British Trade Union Movement, and organised it into an effective militia force during the revolution.\n\nGallacher, though initially opposed to Niclas y Glais's devolution efforts, has become satisfied with the current state of affiars."

POLITICS_EDWARD_BRITAIN_DESC:0 "Edward of Windsor, with the passing of his father, 'King-Emperor', George V, was coronated in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom again proudly fly above the British Isles."
POLITICS_TE_LAWRENCE_UK_DESC:0 "Thomas Edward Lawrence, the famous officer and archaeologist who unsuccessfully led the Arab tribes in rebellion against the Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg, has led a coup against the government of the Union of Britain. Rumors abounded that Lawrence harboured monarchist sentiments. and indeed such speculation proved correct.

POLITICS_CARLOS_ALBERTO_BRENES_DESC:0 "Carlos Alberto Brenes, a former ally of Guardia Nacional leader, Anastasio Somoza García, assumed the presidency following a compromise between American-backed agricultural interests and the Guardia. While he maintains some degree of independence from the Guardia Nacional, he is both unwilling and unable to curtail its pervasive political influence."
POLITICS_JUAN_BAUTISTA_SACASA_DESC:0 "Juan Bautista Sacasa is the new reformist president of the United Provinces. His Partido Liberal oppose the corruption and political violence so common under the Guardia Nacional controlled regimes of the past. With Sacasa's election, the United Provinces will almost certainly become a more free and democratic nation."
POLITICS_REAL_SOMOZA_DESC:0 "Anastasio Somoza García is the leader of the infamous Guardia Nacional and now president of the United Provinces. His authoritarian regime is widely accused of extra-judicial killings and fraud, and opposition elements in the United Provinces remain constantly guarded for fear of crackdowns and Guardia infiltration."

He is a man of the Democratic establishment, a mildly conservative politician, and, most importantly, a fervent supporter of democracy. This Texan judge sees no reason in compromise with either the left or the right."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_DESC:0 "A former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and now the current President of the United States, Herbert Hoover has solidified his position as one of the most hated men in American history. Despite only making the Great Depression worse during his first term, Hoover was reelected through the House of Representatives in 1932, causing widespread outrage. It's a sad reality for the President - any and all of his attempts for restoring the economy fail, his tries to calm the situation down only make it worse, and even his own party is turning away from him."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_DESC:0 "Hated by foreign governments and by his own people for being the first dictator of the United States, Commander-in-Chief Douglas MacArthur is no weakling. Brought in by the American establishment to rid the country of radicalism, this general runs the nation just like he used to lead his regiment - with order, strict discipline and heavy punishment for all who speak out against him. He sincerely believes that he is here to save the United States - but would the Founding Fathers even support his actions?"
POLITICS_HUEY_LONG_DESC:0 "It's hard to say what the Governor of Louisiana, Huey Long exactly stands for. Some would say that his 'Share Our Wealth' programme is clearly just Syndicalism in new clothing, while others would point at his undemocratic, nepotist style of rule, topped by the usage of the 'Minutemen' paramilitary to harass rivals, as a sign of his National Populist stance. Whatever may be the case, President Long is liked by the common classes, his charisma is exceptional, even if he can get arrogant at times, and his foothold over the south is not to be underestimated."

POLITICS_VLADIMIR_DESC:0 "King Uladzimir von Hohenzollern, nephew of Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, though German by birth, has largely assimilated into Ruthenian culture. Though his adopted nation is poor, and by German standards quite backwards, it is rapidly modernising. With an increasingly uncertain political climate both in Belorussia and abroad, Uladzimir seeks to lead his country and people into a brighter future while mitigating the influence of political radicals."

POLITICS_YAHYA_HAMID_DESC:0 "From 1934 to 1948, Yahya redirected his energies toward internal consolidation of his authority and the creation of a viable central government, answerable to him personally. To this end, control of the hinterland was strengthened by the establishment of a standing army and the naming of his sons as governors of key provinces. Tighter control over affairs in Sana'a, the capital, was assured by expanding the scope of administrative functions and appointing other sons as supervisors of old and new political institutions . The regime sent Yemen's first students abroad military cadets to the ottomans in the 1930s and civilian students, the Famous Forty, to Egypt in the late 1940s. An early attempt was made to introduce some direction to the nascent national economy by the establishment of a Yemen trading company. Even with these changes, Yahya's Yemen was a semi-feudal state in which even the most basic measures required his personal approval."
POLITICS_ALI_NASSAR_AL-QADARI_DESC:0 "The son of Sheikh Nasser bin Mas'ad. Ali Nasser had a common background. As a sunni, he took up rebellion against Imam Yahya in 1928 when the Imam has imposed his rule over Aden. Al Nasser then fled the Imam's draft, and joined the rebels. The rebellion saw Ali Nasser tap into his artisitc side, waxing poetic about his mission to kill the Imam. To this end, he joined the underground Hait al-Nadial organization, and through his expressive voice became their leader."
POLITICS_SHABAB_AL-AMR_DESC:0 "Out of Ta'izz, the Numan family could be described as middle class. As a sunni, Ahmad could not attain a proper education in muslim science to advance in Yemen. This may have been due to rumors that his family was descended from Yemeni Jews. Instead, Ahmad was educated in western logic at the al Madrassa al Ahliyya. This school eventually played host to Ahmad's reform group Nadi a Islah. The Nadi a Islah saw both the Mutawakkili kingdom and the Ottoman Caliphate as relics that held back Yemen. He formed a program that disguised social reforms behind the terminology of ractionaries. Promoting the Good and Preventing the Bad was allowed his rebellion to sway otherwise conservatives Yemenis. Ultimately, this proclemation for Yemen was to ease change into a country badyl divided. "

POLITICS_LALA_LAJPAT_RAI_DESC:0 "Lala Lajpat Rai, Punjabi Hindu philanthropist, returned from championing Indian independence in the United States to formulate the creation of a new socialist state in India. With the collapse of British rule in late 1925, Rai, along with other Indian socialist figureheads, proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of Bengal. While the People's Republic initially failed to unite India through force, it managed to consolidate its rule over the northeastern third of the sub-continent. Rai, once relatively secure in his leaderhsip of the People's Republic, renamed the Bharatiya Commune to indicate its ambition of unification, now faces spirited opposition from competing socialist factions. With his advanced age and waning influence, Rai has announced his intent to resign from his post. His successor may well determine the future of the Commune itself."
POLITICS_FAZLUL_HUQ_DESC:0 "Fazlul Huq, former secretary of the Bengali Muslim League, and now an avowed Syndicalist, has led his 'Moderate' faction to victory in the Indian National Congress's special session. He campaigned on a platform of trade-union centric industrialisation and the gradual implimenation of socialist reform. Despite electoral success, however, Fuq still faces staunch opposition from opposing factions of the Indian National Congress. Regardless, Fuq's vision of prosperity in the historically impoverished eastern India, and perhaps oneday the entire sub-continent, appears, at least to his supporters, to be increasingly achievable."
POLITICS_CHANDRA_BOSE_DESC:0 "As a boy, Subhas Chandra Bose once assaulted a British schoolmaster for defaming his beloved India; his expulsion thereafter left Bose with an almost rabid desire for vengance. Shortly before the collapse of the British Raj, Bose attracted large swaths of the Indian population to the socialist cause with incendiary speeches against the all who would deny India's people sole dominion over the sub-continent. With the success of Bose's Maximists within the Indian National Congress, the Bharatiya Commune as a whole has begun to assume a similarly militaristic outlook; it now looks to strike a decisive blow to the hearts of the Dominionists and Princely Federation alike."
POLITICS_MOHANDAS_GHANDI_DESC:0 "A former lawyer, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi valued highly the gradual, peaceful, and lawful independence of India from British rule. With the collapse of the Raj, however, he and his many followers were forced to reassess their position. Though still a propenent of pacifism, Ghandi has become increasingly influenced by the ideas of his colleagues in the now radicalised Indian National Congress. Ghandi's victory in the Indian National Congress's special session has awoken renewed hope for the peaceful reunification of the Indian sub-continent and the reconciliation of its divided factions."
POLITICS_JAWAHARLAL_NEHRU_DESC:0 "Jawaharlal Nehru is almost certainly the most tactful of the Bharatiya Commune's prominent political leaders. With the collapse of the British Raj, Nehru, while a staunch advocate for immediate independence from the weakened Empire, worked tireless to mediate all manner of disputes among Indian leaders across the political spectrum. While his detractors would slander Nehru as indecisive and cowardly, Nehru's subtle political manoeuvring was essential for his ascension to the highest levels of the Indian National Congress, and now the Bharatiya Commune itself. Under Nehru's leadership, perhaps the factionalism which has plagued the Congress for decades may finally be assauged."
POLITICS_NIRMAL_KUMAR_BOSE_DESC:0 "Nirmal Kumar Bose, protégé of the famous Mohandas Gandhi, has assumed leadership of the Bharatiya Commune. He is likely to continue the agrarian reforms of Ghandi, and encourage the non-violent reunification of India. Many dissidents within the Bharatiya Commune, however, are displeased with Bose's rise to power, believing, despite official explanations to the contrary, that Bose masterminded Ghandi's demise."
POLITICS_SHRIPAD_AMRIT_DANGE_DESC:0 "Shripad Amrit Dange is perhaps the most radical syndicalist within the Indian National Congress. Much like Nestor Makhno of the French Anarchistes, he advocates the eventual disestablishment of the very state itself. Unlike the Anarchistes however, rather than promoting rural collectivisation, Dange advocates industrialisation and the assumption by trade unions of the entire economic apparatus."

POLITICS_FARABUNDO_MARTI_DESC:0 "Farabundo Martí is the Syndicalist former leader of then semi-autonomous El Salvador. He seeks to transform Centroamérica into a bastion of Communard style syndicalism. With syndicalist success at the Socialist Congressional Union, his dream may yet come to fruition."

POLITICS_SEBASTIEN_FAURE_DESC:0 "Sébastien Faure is the first Anarchiste to serve as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Originally empowered to chairman in a compromise between the Travailleurs and Anarchistes, factionalism has grown considerably during his time in office, and the apparatus of the state has weakened. If any faction manages to gain a clear majority in the Comité de Salut Public and the Bourse Générale du Travail, Faure is likely to be ousted."
POLITICS_LEON_JOUHAUX_DESC:0 "Léon Jouhaux has been elected Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Jouhaux, as a revolutionary trade unionist, participated in the general strike of 1919 which precipitated the Commune's establishment. He is an adherent of orthodox French syndicalism, a true centrist among the factions of the Commune."
POLITICS_BENOIT_FRACHON_DESC:0 "Benoît Frachon, a veteran of the French Civil War, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. While a Syndicalist, he is sympathetic towards the opposing anarchiste faction; to that end, he has declared mending the Commune's factionalism the chief goal of his chairmanship."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "General Maurice Gamelin has overthrown the Jacobin regime of Marcel Déat. While his coup is an obvious affront to the already dubious Communard democratic process, many now regard Gamelin as the saviour of the Commune, and even syndicalism itself."
POLITICS_MARCEL_CACHIN_DESC:0 "Marcel Cachin, former diplomat and bureau chief of the state-owned newspaper, Humanité, has become chairman of the Commune of France. While a Leninist, his diplomatic attitude and general charisma, allow him to retain some degree cordialility with syndicalists and anarchists."
POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Georges Valois, an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Nestor Makhno, Ukrainian anarchist, fled his homeland for France following German intervention in the Russian Civil War. Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his French electoral victory. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the forseeable future, but his support for decentralisation could forever transform the Commune."
POLITICS_JACQUES_DORIOT_DESC:0 "Jacques Doriot, veteran of the Weltkrieg, returned from captivity in Germany to find a France forever changed. His personal transformation from moderate socialist, to Leninist, and now national-syndicalist, has instilled in him an engrained proclivity for compromise."

POLITICS_DANIEL_GUERIN_DESC:0 "Daniel Guérin has now not only usurped from the charismatic Nestor Makhno leadership of the Anarchiste faction of the French Commune, but also won the chairmanship itself. Guérin is an academic, and a moderate in comparison to Makhno, who has proven to be a capable lawmaker."

POLITICS_CHAMBER_OF_PRINCES_DESC:0 "The Chamber of Princes was originally established by King-Emperor George V during the Weltkrieg to appease the increasingly unruly Indian nobility. The instability and political violence that followed the British revolution necessitated that, to maintain authority, the unelected Chamber was delegated substantial governmental authority, and eventually reorganized into the proper upper-house of the now bi-cameral Indian legislature. Upon the death of the viceroy of India, the Chamber is responsible for appointing a successor."
POLITICS_GANGA_SINGH_DESC:0 "Ganga Singh, prince of Bikaner, proved a capable military leader during the Weltkrieg, eventually becoming the only Indian member of the British Imperial War Cabinet. Not just a military man however, Singh proved to be an astute politician, gaining a substantial following by advocating sweeping yet gradual reform of India's convoluted political system. In his push for reform however, Singh maintained cordiality with the British administration, and gained the admiration of sympathetic aristocrats. Due to his popularity, Singh's support was crucial for then Viceroy, Rufus Isaacs, in transforming India from an appendage of the British Empire into an independent Dominion."

POLITICS_ATUL_CHANDRA_CHATTERJEE_DESC:0 "Atul Chandra Chatterjee, diplomat and moderate labor activist, served diligently in the British Raj's 'Indian Civil Service'; he was the British High Commissioner to India when the British Revolution struck, and upended India's political system. His efforts were pivotal to the establishment of the Dominion's foreign service, even personally managing most of his nation's diplomats when issues arose. Following Viceroy Ganga Singh's appointment, Chatterjee became even more prominent in India politics, even striking up a friendship with Singh. Chatterjee has been a vocal advocate of state protection of the rights of India's industrial laborers."
POLITICS_SRINIVASA_SASTRI_DESC:0 "Srinivasa Sastri, who founded the Indian Liberal Party after leaving the Indian National Congress, is renowned for negotiating a degree of autonomy for India shortly before the British Revolution. Sastri, though once nearly incarcerated for his association with the Indian Home Rule League, and not opposed to India's recent declaration of a republic, is quite an anglophile; he believes that the institutions established by the British should be maintained."
POLITICS_MINOCHER_MASANI_DESC:0 "Minocher Rustom Masani, a vocal proponent of classical liberalism, split with the Indian National Congress due to the Congress's drift towards socialism. Masani is a charismatic and good-natured man, who, despite policy disagreements, maintains personal friendships with many political rivals, even those of the Indian National Congress. Minocher similarly enjoys even the most mundane of political decision, often speaking for hours on end on the floor of parliament on the minutia of financial decisions and administrative budgets. Minocher's attention to detail and gregarious nature has won him a large political following."
POLITICS_NARASIMHA_KELKAR_DESC:0 "Narasimha Chintaman Kelkar split with the Indian National Congress due to the Congress's increasingly socialist stance. Shortly before the disintegration of the British Raj, Kelkar, and other more liberal Congress defectors founded the Swaraj (meaning independence or self-governance) Party to promote parliamentarian democracy in India. Kelkar is not only a man of politics, however; he is an accomplished playwright, and his works have been responsible for igniting increased national identity and political consciousness among the people of India."

Though once a member of the Indian National Congress, Munshi bears a disdain for socialism, and abandoned the Congress due to its leftward drift. Munshi believes that to assure liberty for the people of India and safeguard against the encroachment of insidious socialist influence, property rights must be protected, while the estates of India's landed aristocracy must be broken up."
POLITICS_KRISHNA_MENON_DESC:0 "Krishna Menon, often accused of harbouring sympathies for socialism and the Indian National Congress, has nonetheless, become one of India's most prominent political figures. Menon is a masterful manipulator, playing the game of Indian politics much like a grandmaster would play a round of chess. With the death of his political ally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Menon was forced to step out from the shadows, and become the face of the moderate left in India. Menon is as distrustful of the West as of political rivals, fearing any continued association with the remnants of the British Empire could lead India to ruin."

Khan began his political career as an ally of leftist Muhammad Jinnah, but drifted further from Jinnah with time. He joined the conservative Unionist Party, which had split from the Jinnah's Home Rule Party over dissatisfaction with Jinnah's leadership, and disagreement with the Party's endorsement of land redistribution; this split between Jinnah and Khan has created a political rift amongst Indian Muslims."
POLITICS_CHHOTU_RAM_DESC:0 "Chhotu Ram, after helping to found the Unionist Party, withdrew from politics to focus on social work. Ram's work led to a marked increase in the standard of living of some of the most destitute people of Punjab, and the name 'Chhotu Ram' was soon on the lips of a great many Indians. Upon his return to politics, Ram set out to reform the Unionist Party, which had evolved from an alliance of Punjabi Jats and Muslims into an organisation for the protection of the rural nobility of northern India."
POLITICS_MALIK_KHIZAR_TIWANA_DESC:0 "Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana, upon returning from service in the Weltkrieg, became distraught at the division and political violence which had consumed India. Tiwana took up arms against the marauding socialists loyal to the breakaway government in Bengal. Tiwana committed himself in the fragile peace that followed to bring unity to the Indian sub-continent. He joined the conservative Unionist party based in his native Punjab and quickly rose to its leadership."

POLITICS_ADALBERT_I_DESC:0 "Adalbert von Hohenzollern's tenure as king of the Flems and Walloons has been quite peculiar. Inaugurated not by coronation, but by swearing an oath on the constitution, Adalbert, who also converted to Catholicism to align himself with his nation's populace, has long sought the respect, if not admiration, of his people. Years of oppression under the German regime and a tendency for Adalbert to cling on to a more absolutist type of monarchy than the Belgian system have led to great anti-German sentiment among the populace, making Adalbert despised and hated amongst the common folk."
POLITICS_ALBERT_I_DESC:0 "Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the king who trounced the invading Germans at the Yzer, has returned to Belgium from exile in Canada. When his motorcade entered Brussels for the first time since the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, church bells across the nation rang, and many Belgians weeped with joy. German collaborators and syndicalists, however, lament the restored king, and plot to undermine the new Belgian government. Albert must now mend the deep wounds which have marred Belgium, and create a renewed sense of hope among the its people."
POLITICS_JORIS_SEVEREN_DESC:0 "Joris Van Severen, Flemish leader who begrudgingly cooperated with the occupying Germans, has assumed control of the country. His Verdinaso has a radical vision for the direction of Belgium, including territorial expansion and the promotion of Catholicism in all aspects of society. Under van Severen, a new Belgium will certainly arise; though that new nation may be incredibly different from the one that came before it."
POLITICS_PAUL_ZEELAND_DESC:0 "Paul van Zeeland and the Catholic Party led Flemish resistance to German control. With electoral victory in the now restored Belgium, van Zeeland endeavours to establish Chistian Democracy in Belgium, and reconcile that which divides Belgium's people, Flems and Walloons alike. Principle among his policy goals is the betterment of working conditions for both farmers and industrial laborers."
POLITICS_BELGIAN_PARLIMENT_DESC:0 "The Belgian Parliament, successor to the Flemish Council which advised the German controlled government of Flanders-Wallonia, has assumed power in the recently restored Belgium. While the Government is restructured and elections prepared, Parliament acts not just as a legislature, but collectively as interim head of state."
POLITICS_HENRIK_MAN_DESC:0 "Henrik de Man, a moderate social democrat, has consolidated his leadership of the Belgian Workers' Party, and now achieved victory in Belgium's latest national elections. De Man advocates limited economic nationalisation and the empowerment of union leaders to a governmental advisory role. Belgium, De Man believes, must actively serve its people and promote fair competition; his reforms, though controversial, may yet decrease economic hardship and political radicalisation in Belgium."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_JACQUEMOTTE_DESC:0 "Joseph Jacquemotte, creator and editor of the leftist pre-Weltkrieg newpaper 'L'Exploité', and his Syndicalist faction of the Belgian Workers' Party have achieved victory both within the party, and now, Belgium itself. Jacquemotte advocates rural industrialisation and the collectvisation of industry and agriculture alike. A Belgium led by Jacquemotte is certain to see drastic societal and economic upheaval."
POLITICS_PAUL_HENRI_SPAAK_DESC:0 "Paul Henri Spaak, once a prominent lawyer, believes that, above all else, to truely serve the people, government bureaucracy must be efficient. Spaak is now in contol of the Belgian Workers' Party, and the party's subsequent victory in the most recent Belgian national elections has elevated him to head of state. Spaak has already begun to greatly decrease the bloated Belgian civil service and introduced new incentives to prospective entrepreneurs; as a result, optimism seems to be steadily increasing in Belgium."
POLITICS_PAUL_EMILE_JANSON_DESC:0 "Paul-Émile Janson and his Liberal Party has achieved victory in Belgium's latest national elections. Janson is an advocate of laissez faire economics and free trade; all aspects of society, to Janson, have been far too regulated by past administrations. Belgium, under Janson, is quickly becoming one of the most economically free nations in Europe and the world."

POLITICS_PHAM_VAN_DONG_DESC:0 "In 1924, Pham Van Dong travelled to southern China. There, he met Ho Chi Minh, and quickly became one of his most trusted confidants and leaders of men. He witnessed the tragic end of Vietnamese syndicalist movement and fled to France. In exile, he developed an interest in the ideology of French Jacobins, Vanguardism. The idea of a vanguard group of disciplined intellectuals leading the revolution captured him. After the split of the League in 1931, he founded Tan Viet party and started infiltrating the colony. Most of his colleagues find him forever diligent and energetic, a reliable and loveable person as well as an ideal organiser and administrator. On the other hand, his enemy fear his ability to run the party and state machine."
POLITICS_TA_THU_THAO_DESC:0 "This young radical almost shouldn't have been the chairman of the prestigious Indochinese Revolutionary League, but he is and he is well respected by his colleagues. Ta Thu Thau became a prominent activist in Saigon in the mid-1920s and joined the League in its darkest days. After the split in 1931 gave another heavy blow to the League, Ta Thu Thau rose to power. This sharp intellectual has intentionally modelled Ho Chi Minh's leading style since his assuming of the title of Chairman, trying to calm factional tensions and strengthen solidarity. The recovery of the League from the collapse largely credited to his efforts. Now, he is determined to achieve the unfulfilled dream of the martyrs——build syndicalism in Indochina."
POLITICS_NGUYEN_AN_NINH_DESC:0 "Nguyen An Ninh is respected by most Indochinese intellectuals as the true democratic soul of Indochina. He studied in Sorbonne and participated the French Revolution in 1919. In 1922, Nguyen An Ninh, Nguyen The Truyen and Nguyen Ai Quoc (Ho Chi Minh) met in Marseille and decided to plan the liberation of their motherland. Nguyen An Ninh returned to Indochina in 1924 and was arrested by German police for radical agitation. After witness the crackdown of Indochinese syndicalism, Nguyen An Ninh decided that Indochinese revolution must rely on the spontaneous uprising of peasants. Since then, he started the Aspiration Society, modelling on traditional secret societies. He often personally travels from village to village under the disguise of a monk or herbist, selling his self-made ointment, and secretly recruit members to sow the seeds of revolution. He thus won great popularity among peasants in the Mekong Delta. While his dream of complete transforming the personality of Indochinese people might not realise in the foreseeable future, his emphasis on cultural enlightenment, autonomy and spontaneity will deeply reshape Indochinese society."
POLITICS_NGUYEN_TAI_HOC_DESC:0 "Nguyen Tai Hoc is the founding leader of the Viet Nam Quo Dan Dang, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party. He was a supporter of colonial reformism, but later dissapointed at the empty promises of the colonial regime and became the leader of revolutionary nationalism. Although the Yen-Bai mutiny failed, his successful escape from German police after that tragedy adds another chapter in his heroic deeds. Influenced by Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, he envisages a democratic republic truly for people's welfare."

POLITICS_AZIZ_JBS_DESC:0 "The Rashids triumphant, the young Abdulaziz Rashid takes his place as the First among the Emirs of Arabia. His father's tent now replaced with a palace far away from the harshness of his childhood. Abdulaziz Rashid now looks towards a the frontiers of traditional Arabia where his tribe can prosper. Abdulaziz Rashid proclaims that his dynasty will replace the authoritarian attitude of Wahabbism. At the same time however, salafists flock to Ha'il to pitch to Abdulaziz a renewal of Mu'taizilism that his sunni followers see as the next step in modernizing Islam."
POLITICS_GHAZI_DESC:0 "The only son of the late Faisal bin Hussein, Ghazi escaped the wrath of the Turks in Hejaz by hiding in El Esah with his cousin Zeid bin Hussein. In El Esah, Ghazi was cared for by the remaining forces of Lawrence's rebellion, but financial assistance from Britain dried up in 1926. This left Ghazi to seek protection from Ottoman soldiers with the Howietat. This led to a temporary truce between the Rashids and the Hashmites when the Howietat were admitted into Jabal Shammar. The influence of Ghazi's name is still strong, as well as the legacy of the Arab Revolt among Bedouins yearning for freedom. Thus it was Ghazi's triumphant return to Mecca after the fall of the Ottomans that restored the greatness of his name."
POLITICS_SAEED_DUBAI_DESC:0 "Where war and rivalry only led to the stagnation of Arabia, trade and deleation will restore. This came from a speech given by the Emir Saeed al Maktoum upon recieving his office. His term as Emir of Dubai was one of exemplary diplomacy and a care for his peoples' well being. Submission to the Sauds over a bloodbath in the 1920s, creation of economic ties to India when pearling failed the emirate, and finally a promise of peace. His dynasty being unilaterally more wealthy than the Rashids or Hashmitie may of helped as well."
POLITICS_SHAKBUT_IRQ_DESC:0 "The House Al Nahyan was stuck in the crossroads of the Saud Rashid war. Their cities taxed cruelly by the Sauds, and thier commerce stunted. This destruction resolved Shakhbut Al Nahyan to formulate an economic plan for recovery involving western economists. This plan was presented to the Emirs, and early sucesses paved the way to Shakhbut's election. Al Nahyan weaves in hsi speeches the tales of how his ancestors of the Bani Yas migrated to the coast and found a land suitable to grow. Shakhbut's personal repuation among the Emirs is outstanding, and is only corrupted by the schemes of his own family. Shakhbut is confident that his repuation can save him from the macinations of family politics."
POLITICS_ABTAN_IRQ_DESC:0 "Atban was the one time rival and now successor to the famous soldier and Sheikh Auda abu Tayi. When Auda's ambitons failed, he retreated from Aqab into the Al Nefud. The Howietat's livestock starved, wells were denied to them. In desperation Atban ibn Jazi choose to again put aside his rivalry for the sake of thier people and seek aid from the Rashids. This bid was sucessful, and Atban became the representative of the Howietat. Auda's and his reputations for joining the Arab Revolt and facing the harshest of the turkish reprisals made Atban a surprisingly good candidate for Emir. Atban challenged the Emirs to live among their own, and was rewarded with cooperation."
POLITICS_SABAH_IRQ_DESC:0 "The Emirs of Kuwait began the century by setting the Rashid Saud conflict in motion, and it has finally paid off for them with the ascension of Jabe Al Sabah. It was Jaber's father who gave the Sauds arms and men in 1906 to retake Riyadh, a decision that would come back to haunt his son. The Ikhwan, Ibn Sauds frenzied soldiers attacked Kuwait when the British left, leaving devestation along thw 1st Ring Road. Al Sabah prostrated himself to the Rashids, who forgave him and announced their protection of Kuwait. Now the Sabah are owed favors from the Rashids accrued during wartime, who exchanged this debt for a promise to elect Jaber al Sabah. Jaber himself reminding the emirs that he was first into battle on his horse against the Sauds, and that he alone could lead the charge against the Ottomans."
POLITICS_SYNDIE_JBS_DESC:0 "A brother to Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Abdulaziz, Mishaal did not follow his family path. His interests came not from the numerous clans that paraded through Hail, but from the ordinary citizens of Shammar. It was under his mothers instruction that Mishaal came to see the Rashid Emir and all emirates as haughty and aloof. This pushed Mishaal into seeking examples of leaders connected to their people. He found inspiration in Muhammad al Ashmar, whose provockative ideas about islamic law. Mishaal came to believe that Islamic Law tended towards socialism, so he made that clear to his family. Mishaal's exile ended when the Internationale entered Arabia, and people remarked that he was the only among the Emirs to express concern for the common peopele. In this strange way, Mishaal vindicated his familys name."

POLITICS_MICHAEL_COLLINS_DESC:0 "Michael Collins is the saviour and national hero of Ireland, with a combination of popularity and rigged elections keeping him in power. Born in Cork, Collins fought in the 1916 Easter Rising and afterwards became the president of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. During the war he organised the IRA into an effective guerrilla force, seeking to avoid the mistakes of 1916. In 1921 he was sent to negotiate the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Although by threatening to continue the war with German backing he was able to acquire all thirty-two counties in the treaty, he was unable to secure a republic, with the British fearing that an independent Irish republic would immediately become a German base. When he was expelled from Sinn Féin by Éamon de Valera he managed to form his own party, Fine Gael, which quickly overtook Sinn Féin in popularity. After the British Revolution he declared an independent Republic of Ireland and defeated a Unionist uprising in Ulster. Now with the Second Weltkrieg approaching Collins advocates revitalising Ireland's economy and military in order to assert Ireland's independence."
POLITICS_CATHAL_BRUGHA_DESC:0 "Born Charles William St. John Burgess of mixed Catholic and Protestant heritage, and later changing his name after joining the Gaelic League, Cathal Brugha is a war hero from the Easter Rising and leader of the rump Sinn Féin following the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He, already being a staunch rival of Collins during the War of Independence, became leader of the democratic opposition, a coalition of democratic parties opposing Collins, although he has increasingly become a figurehead to rally around in his old age as a new generation rises in the Republican movement. He and his party, bolstered in strength by many ex-Labourites following the 1923 ban after Larkin's failed uprising, advocate a social democratic Ireland as per the Democratic Programme of 1919, and a pro-German alignment to oppose Ireland's enemies in Britain and Canada."

Afterwards, he emigrated to America only to return to Ireland after the American economic collapse, and joined the anglophile National Centre Party, eventually becoming its leader due to his great oratory skills. A presistent critic of both the Collins' government and the democratic opposition's sympathies towards isolationism or Germanophilia, he is a strong advocate of a pro-Entente policy and rapproachment with the Unionist community."
POLITICS_JIM_LARKIN_DESC:0 "James Larkin, born in England before moving with his family to Ireland grew up in poverty and became a trade union organiser and formed the Labour Party with James Connolly, most famously participating in the failed Dublin Lockout of 1913. After the failure of the lockout, he moved to America and became a member of the Socialist Party of America. Upon his return to Ireland in 1923 he received a hero's welcome from Irish syndicalists and took control of the Labour Party, hoping to launch a syndicalist rising as in France over disappointments with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The rising was a failure with informers revealing the plans of the ICA rebels beforehand and the Labour Party was banned, leading Larkin to go into hiding with the help of the Commune of France. The Irish Citizen Army suffered dear for their loyalty, with their role in the Easter Rising being erased from the official history and their founder James Connolly's role downplayed."

As Minister for Justice, he passed laws repressing syndicalism as well as anti-traveller settlement laws against the Pavee community, as well as using his influence to encourage the Irish language. He also maintained links with the Romanian Iron Guard, expressing sympathy for establishing a similar regime in Ireland. To this end, he formed his own party Ailtirí na hAiséirghe that would revive the Irish language, ban the English language after a period of five years, and establish strong anti-syndicalist and anti-Semitic policies."

Lemass is an advocate for industrialisation and while he is a believer in capitalism, he also believes that normalising relations with the Union of Britain could have a beneficial effect on Irish trade and the economy. He is in favour of a flexible Irish foreign policy depending on the nation's needs, contrasting the CPNH from the other democratic parties who have their own biases in regards to Irish foreign policy."

He disagreed with the Anglo-Irish treaty and participated in the 1923 attempted uprising by the ICA, fleeing to the Commune of France after its failure, meeting with many French Jacobins while there and adopting some of their ideas. He later returned to Ireland to secretly continue agitating against the Irish government."

POLITICS_AZIZ_JBS_DESC:0 "Perhaps it was cruel fate that Saud bin Abdulaziz incurred the wrath of an Emir named Abdulaziz ibn Saud. Saud bin Abdulaziz was no stranger to strange and terrible events. The young Emir's crowning at age ten a machination of the Al Sabhan family, his maternal family. He witnessed as a young man the death of famous British Explorer William Shakespear without ever realizing the humor in his name, or that his death would leave the Rashids with no allies during the Weltkrieg. Despite squabbling, the loss of the Rashid army to British maxim guns and a betrayal by his cousin, the Rashid family survived. A head on his shoulders allowed him to secure a protection deal with the Emir of Kuwait, the leader of the Howietat, and an unsteady peace with Nejd. Now this Emir is grown and ready to lead Arabia through the violence and betrayal towards a brighter future."

POLITICS_BAKR_SIDIQI_DESC:0 "Unlike many Kurds that joined the Ottoman Army's special Hamidiye units, Bakr Sidqi joined the general army alongside Arabs in after training in Istanbul. This slot allowed him to gain allies within the Ottoman command throughout the Weltkrieg. After many divisions of the Ottoman 4th Army were discharged in 1921, Sidqi managed the welfare of both Arab and Kurd troops in Kirkuk. Sidqi cultivated a loyalty in his men towards him above official orders, which i=only increased when military pensions were cut in 1922. When the Assyrian rebelled in 1925, Bakr personally led his troops through towns killing soldiers and civilians alike. It was this ruthless efficiency and the recent desertion of the Hamidiye that gave Bakr an informal rule as military governor of the Mosul Vilyet. Bakr's aim is to subordinate the kurdish tribes under his military clique with the help of Arab and Turkish soldiers."
POLITICS_BARZANJI_DESC:0 "Sheikh Mahmud Barzanji is the leader and patriarch of the Barzanji clan living to the north of Mosul. Although Mahmud himself is Sunni, his ancestor Musa Kazem of the Twelver Shia gives him authority over Kurds in Ardelan. Mahmud has spent the last decade gathering arms and supporters from Iranian Kurdistan for revolt. This revolt is planned the same way prior Kurdish revolts have, and the incredible success has bolstered Kurdish claims that their dynasty is as legitimate as the Qajars or Osman."
POLITICS_BABA_SHEIKH_DESC:0 "Nominally a citizen of Iran, Haji Bana Sheikh was a religious leader for the Mahabad province of Persia before the Weltkrieg. His position as a Sheikh only recognised by the kurds in Mahabad, in which he was considered a moderate Shia leader. When the Russians entered Kurdistan, he formed the Alliance of Islam Committee to seek cooperation with Iran and Azerbaijan. Haji cultivated an ally in General Reza Khan, which has finally paid dividends in Persia's triumph. Haji collaborated with the exiled Mustafa Barzanji in 1932 to establish the PDK, although they soon clashed over whether the party would support Iran's claims or not. Haji's pro Iran position and Reza's support led to a breakdown of this coalition in 1935, though both leaders stay in touch."
POLITICS_MIHEMED_DESC:0 "It was only after the fall of the Soviet Union that Qazi Mihemed had realised his calling was socialism. Born into a rare Kurdish aristocracy and destined to be a poet, Qazi published his poems in Kurdi and Farsi, drawing the ire of the Qajars. His poems never reached the West, as the Khoyboun refused to publish his work. When internationalism finally came to Kurdistan, his works were found in the hands of socialists and he was found and uplifted from a jail in Sanandaj to realise the Kurdish destiny. Unlike most Levantine socialists, he rallies the Kurds in a united faith in Allah instead of nationality."
POLITICS_MUSTAFA_BARZANI_DESC:0 "A relative of the Sheikh Mehmûd Barzanji, Mustafa was only five when his famaily was imprisoned by the Ottoman military. Spending the majority of the Weltkrieg in hiding with his remaining family, Mustafa first became involved in his brother Ahmad's milita in the 1920's. Ahmad's milita attempted to steal arms from the Ottoman 4th Army in 1925, leading to Ahmad's capture and execution. Mustafa fled with the remainder to Azerbaijan, where he joined Haji in establishing the PDK. Mustafa was disturbed to find the Haji had allies in the Persian military, and lobbied for the party to turn away from secularism and cooperation with Iran towards total autonomy and Barzanji tribal laws. Officially Mustafa and his allies are the leaders of the PDK."
POLITICS_SHEIKH_SAID_DESC:0 "Follwoing the end of the Ottoman Caliphate during the War in the Sands, many Kurds formerly belonging to the Hamidiye were discharged without pay. Those soldiers returned to find the Sidqi clique had slandered them as traitors. The Hamidiye moved into the Turkish side of Kurdistan, among the Zaza Kurds and Alevi. Among them was the Azadi Sheikh Said, an adept soldier who felt that the Ottomans were betrayed by secularists. His anti secular position may have alienated the Iranian and Iraqi Kurds, but the Zazas rallied around him. Said reorganised the Hamidiye along with even Turkish volunteers into a fighting force to restore the Caliphate. Said himself was a Naqshbandi Sufi, who felt that Egypt had abandoned the path, and Salfis posed a threat to Sufi existence."
POLITICS_RIZA_DERSHIMI_DESC:0 "Karuman is a member of what had been a Ottoman loyalist family. The Bedirxans had ruled Bohtan for a century leading up to their independence activities. Compared to many other Kurdish nationalists, Kamuran had traveled to Britain prior to their revolution to establish a support group for Kurdish immigrants. His experience in Turkish law allowed him to arrange for people to leave Kurdistan for Britain until 1924. Following the revolution, Kamuran worked in the Commune of France developing new alphabet based on French to enable Kurds to spread their message internationally. This work was allowed despite his dealings with the former empires, until 1929 when his residency was revoked. This turned him against socialism, and his publications made out of Turkey reflected this. He is brought in as a competent economist and intellectual President of Kurdistan, in order to give dignity to the post."

Compliance with the Ottoman Caliphate was never fully embraced by the many sufis in Tripoltania. The Weltkrieg broke the Senussi solidarity, and Ahmed Sharif fell out of favor to his cousin Idris, who was declared Al Mahdi as Senussi during the crisis. Thanks to an army raised by Ottoman General Nuri Killigil, Ahmed Sharif was able to oust Idris and force him into exile in Egypt. Italy's disssoltiuon provided the prextext to invade Fezzan, and thus Ahmed Sharif became the first King of Tripolitania under Ottoman protection. A newfound hostility has found Ahmed adrift from his former allies in Al Ahzar university in Cairo, with his subordinates slowly being replaced by Turkish yes men and foreign trained intellectuals."

Sharif came to regret this in 1911 when the Italians came to Cyrenica. A pragmatist and a pacifist, Sharif yielded to the Italians. His ward Omar insitagted the people of Bayda into resistance against the Italians and Sharif. Omar's loyalists left Sharif to tend to the casualties of war, these victims would later remember Sharif's dedication to survival, and elected him leader of the Republic.

Maziq's family submitted to the Senussi order when Idris reclaimed the land from the Italians, and were put in touch with the legendary commander Omar Mukhtar. Maziq covertly supported Idris in exile, and simultaniously educated himself in Italian and French to work with industrialists. When the Second Weltkrieg came to Tripolitania, his organisation helped people evacuate to Algiers. Now this reputation has become known, and the grateful people of Libya have elected him President."

But when the Italians were occupying Qasr Abu Hadi, the illiterate Abu Meniar bought schoolbooks in Italian. His journey towards literacy in Italian continued after their army retreated, and his fascination witn changes happening in Europe led him to move his family to Tripoli in 1923. Tripoli being the center for Italian expats, Abu Meniar began reading Il Popolo d'Italia. Mussolinis strive for the unity of Italian people to overcome poverty led Meinar to ingratiate himself with the right people.

He was one of the first volunteers in the Lithuanian army in 1918, and soon worked his way to Major General, but he was quick to realise that there will be no free and independent Lithuania under the German thumb. Škirpa and a number of minor disgruntled officers formed the Iron Wolf Organisation, a National Populist paramilitary fighting against German rule and the Slavic minorities within the Kingdom, as well as the Party of Lithuanian Interests as the movement's political arm. And now, he is in charge, under the Lithuanian equivalent title of the Romanian Conducator or Russian Vozhd - Tautos Vadas."
POLITICS_MINDAUGAS_III_DESC:0 "Born as Karl Gero von Urach, the son of Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, Mindaugas III ascended to the throne of Lithuania after his father's death in 1929, and has ruled this Baltic nation since. Even though he bears the name of the first king of Lithuania, it's unifier and folk hero, Mindaugas III is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him. And Karl Gero is as much of a foreigner to them. It's hard to say if Mindaugas III would survive even a day on the throne without the Kaiser backing him from the shadows."
POLITICS_KAZIMIERAS_II_DESC:0 "A Polish-Lithuanian aristocrat from Kretinga, Kazimieras Viktoras Tiškevičius, now Kazimieras II, has committed the greatest sin possible in the eyes of the common Lithuanian - selling out to the Russians and giving up his nation's sovereignity to return the country under the hated eastern tyrant. This event has tainted his image to his people forever, and even though Tiškevičius is a capable administrator, a bright mind and even feels some compassion for the people he rules, his rule over Lithuania is tenuous at best."
POLITICS_VOLDEMARAS_DESC:0 "Augustinas Voldemaras began his political career in the Russian Empire. A committed nationalist, he advocated the national self-determination of Lithuania in Saint Petersburg; with the establishment of the German led Lithuanian puppet government following the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Voldemaras returned to his homeland to again fight for its independence. As head of state, Voldemaras is likely to pursue an ultra-nationalist agenda which promotes the superiority of the Lithuanian people and devotion to the state."

POLITICS_EMILIANO_ZAPATA_DESC:0 "Emiliano Zapata, hero of the Mexican Revolution, achieved victory in Mexico's 1932 Presidential election. Since taking office, he has promoted the development of Mexico's collective farms, 'Ejidos', and through political compromise, fostered closer diplomatic ties with the Commune of France. Zapata, however, faces strong opposition from other socialist factions, as well as remenants of the old regime."
POLITICS_PLUTARCO_CALLES_DESC:0 "General Plutarco Calles has seized control of the Mexican government. While the totalitarian and rabidly anti-clerical tone of Calles's rhetoric are typical of Mexican socialist politicians, his rejection of agrarianism and support for full integration of indigenous Mexicans could represent a radical new direction for Mexico if implemented."
POLITICS_PANCHO_VILLA_DESC:0 "Francisco 'Pancho' Villa's military victories against the armies of dictator Victoriano Huerta, such critical steps on the path to socialist revolution in Mexico, remain legendary in Mexico and abroad. Villa, while often at odds with Zapata, is similarly an agrarian socialist."
POLITICS_PABLO_GONZALEZ_GARZA_DESC:0 "General Pablo Gonzalez Garza was once a steadfast ally of former president Carranza. With the death of Carranza and the ascent of Alvaro Obregón to the Mexican presidency, he went into hiding, waiting for the opportune moment to cleanse his beloved Mexico of socialist corruption; with the success of a military coup in Mexico, he is poised to do just that."
POLITICS_JOSE_URQUIZA_DESC:0 "Jose Antonia Urquiza, fervent catholic and anti-socialist, has outmaneuvred his ostensible allies within the Mexican military to assume control of the presidency. President Urquiza is as certain to promote faith in his Sinarquist regime as faith in God Himself."
POLITICS_VINCENTE_TOLEDANO_DESC:0 "Vicente Toledano, personal aide and confidant of former president, Zapata, has now become president in his own right.

POLITICS_CARLES_DESC:0 "Manuel Carles was born in 1875 in the town of Rosario, Santa Fe province, Argentina. He joined the Union Civica Radical 1898 , which had been gaining popularity as it had recently been formed, back in 1891.He then climbed through the ranks of the party until he managed to become a national deputy for the province of Santa Fe in the national congress. He was assigned in 1918 by his colleague, president Hipólito Yrigoyen, as 'Interventor' of the Salta province to deal with local worker's uprisings. His methods granted him enough experience to be allowed to become a teacher in the 'Colegio Militar de la Nacion' and the 'Escuela Superior de Guerra'. With the unoficial formation of the 'Liga Patriotica' during the 'Semana Tragica', Carles began making contact with the organisation, which was oficially born in 1920 with Carlés as its leader.\n\n From his role as leader of the LP, he began promoting the persecution of jews, anarchists, socialists and certain groups of foreigners. In 1923, another UCR president, Marcelo T. de Alvear named him 'Interventor' of the San Juan province, where he squashed a local peasant uprising with his LP paramilitary force. He then wrote three books: 'Organización de la soberanía','Republica y democracia' and 'Organización de la economia rural', all displaying the changes he wanted Argentina to go through.\n\n When rumours that President Julio Argentino Roca wanted to end the conflict with the FOP began surfacing, Carlés took advantage of popular outrage and his experience in para-military combat and launched a coup d'etat in December 1935. He now sits in the 'Casa Rosada', but his regime has not yet been recognized by the other provinces. Whether he'll be able to secure power remains to be seen..."
POLITICS_DOMINGO_PERON_DESC:0 "Juan Domingo Peron was born in 1895 in the small town of Lobos, Buenos Aires province, Argentina. His family then moved to the Patagonia, where he spent most of his childhood. In 1904, his parents decided to send him with his grandmother in Buenos Aires to get proper schooling, and that was the first time Peron ever saw the big city Buenos Aires is, only ever visiting his parents during summer.\n\n In 1911 he entered the 'Colegio Militar de la Nación' thanks to a scholarship paid by Antonio M. Silva, a close friend of his grandfather. He was named Military History teacher of the 'Escuela Superior de Guerra' in 1930 thanks to his work writing several books regarding military history of both Argentina and other countries. He's hardly had any relevant political position in his life, but the FOP's secession from Argentina caused him great concern. While he is by no means a socialist, his experience in his youth has made him compassionate and empathetic with other dispossessed in the working class. After a short trip to Europe, he has changed his point of view regarding politics, and has returned to Argentina motivated by a will to help the working men of the country and take the nation to new heights. Now, with many in the lower classes, the trade unions and even in the Oligarchy desiring Peron's leadership, it remains to be seen if he will truly be able to achieve his promises...\n\n He got married in 1929 with Aurelia Gabriela Tizon, who sadly died in 1938. He has long overcome her death, and has been seen having private meetings with the famous actress Eva Duarte, commonly known as 'Evita', whom many regard as Peron's next wife."

Her family moved to Argentina in 1890. She met Hipólito Yrigoyen in the 'Escuela Normal Nº1', who was professor of moral and civic instruction, where they kept a friendly relation, with Yrigoyen even lending her books regarding law issues.\n\n In 1906 she founded the Argentinean Feminist Movement, where she was later contacted by members of the 'Partido Socialista Argentino' to give lectures regarding science and education. She would enter the 'Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Buenos Aires' in 1907, where she graduated as a Physician a few years later. Then she organized the first International Women's Congress and made several campaigns to create schools for poor migrants.\n\n However, with the Great War raging on and the anarchist uprisings, her views began to conflict with her colleagues. She envisioned a peaceful transition to a revolutionary society, a concept that clashed with both the LP and the FOP, so she went underground as to protect herself and her newlywed husband, Juan B. Justo, from the violent crackdowns of the Argentinean government. While she hid in small towns of the country working as a medic, she never lost contact with his moderate friends of the Socialist Party.\n\n Always valuing democracy and pacifism, now Mureau has managed to become Head of State, where she is bound to try to take the country towards her vision of a new, equal and peaceful Argentina."
POLITICS_PABLO_RAMIREZ_DESC:0 "Pablo Ramirez was born in 1884, in the small town of La Paz, Entre Rios province, Argentina. He went to military school at a young age, even managing to serve in the German Army until 1913. He was one of the most active members of the 1930 Uriburu's coup d'etat, and was his head of the information service of the general staff until Uriburu's death in 1932. While not a direct member of the GOU, his son is one of the founders, granting him a wide array of military and political contacts that he can use if the situation requires it.\n\n Now that Ramirez has managed to become Head of State, he shall rule Argentina with an iron-fist, trying to enforce the discipline, nationalism and faith in catholicism he was taught to the Argentinean society at large. However it remains to be seen if his connections within the GOU are enough to stay in power if he ever manages to deviate from their vision for Argentina..."
POLITICS_JOSE_TAMBORINI_DESC:0 "Jose Pascual Tamborini was born in 1886 in the Argentinean capital, Buenos Aires City. He joined the 'Union Civica Radical' when he was still in highschool. He was one of the mediators between the workers at the 'Taller Vassena' and the national authorities, where he failed to succesfully reach a compromise, which lead to a major crackdown in the events leading up to the dreaded 'Semana Tragica'. His party didn't fare much better, as the increasing authoritarianism of Yrigoyen began splitting the party into the old 'UCR' and the new 'Union Civica Radical Antipersonalista'.\n\n Tamborini joined the latter while he was minister of the interior during Marcelo T. de Alvear's presidency. In 1935 he was chosen as national deputy, and his political experience has managed to allow him to get enough support to run for presidency. Now that he's head of state, it falls to him to bring about the reforms that Leandro N. Alem, founder of the 'UCR' back in 1891, had envisioned for Argentina, and end once and for all the corrupt practices that have plagued Argentinean democracy!"

He graduated from highschool in 1895 and by 1900, he had graduated the 'Facultad de Derecho y Ciencias Sociales de Buenos Aires' as a Lawyer with a PhD in jurisprudence, accoplishing one of his father's last wishes before he died. Robustiano took over his father's company, 'Patrón Hermanos' and then went on to become involved in Salta's Politics until he was elected governor of the same province between 1913 and 1916 with an independent party. His government in that province was characterized by great political stability and finantial balance, and became one of the first provinces to fully embrace the Saenz Peña law.\n\n In 1932, with the death of Uriburu and the upcoming elections, he formed among other independent leaders the 'Partido Democratico Nacional', where he was chosen as head of the party. Now that Robustiano has managed to achieve presidency, his entrepreneurial spirit, fiscal responsability and compromise skills will surely usher in a new age of economic prosperity for Argentina."

He graduated as physician from the 'Universidad de Buenos Aires' with plenty of experience in surgery thanks to an european internship which lasted until 1897. He was very active in politics from a young age, participating in the 'Revolucion del Parque' in 1890. Afterwards, he founded with his friend, Juan B. Justo, the 'Diario del Pueblo', one of the first socialist newspapers in Argentina. In 1900 he finally decided to afilliate to the 'Partido Socialista' which Justo had helped found, and then both founded the cooperative 'El Hogar Obrero' in 1905.\n\n After the death of Juan B. Justo, he became the obvious candidate of the now more moderate Partido Socialista, which would transform into the 'Partido Democrata Progresista', but didn't managed to win the 1932 national elections. Now that he has managed to become president, he'll strive to turn Argentina away from the exploitative practices of the past and into a better, more egalitarian tomorrow."
POLITICS_HIPOLITO_YRIGOYEN_DESC:0 "Juan Hipólito del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús Yrigoyen was born in 1852 in the Argentinean capital, Buenos Aires City. When he finished high school, he began his political career when he assisted Alem in the creation of the Union Civica, and when it subsequently split during the Roca regime, he continued assisting his uncle with the Union Civica Radical. He kept climbing through the ranks of the party until becoming his uncle right-hand man and participating in the 'Revolución del Parque' as one of the main instigators. However, Alem's suicide became a hard hit for the UCR, and an even harder hit for Yrigoyen, who temporarily retired from politics until 1904, working as a teacher in the meantime.\n\n He then reorganized the UCR in 1904 and managed to get one of his friends, Roque Sáenz Peña, elected as President in 1910, and even becoming President himself from 1916 to 1922. He pushed for progressive reforms and tried to normalize the Argentinean electoral system, even intervening in provinces that were under the control of wealthy elites. He even began granting workers better work laws and began negotiating with many strikers. However, British pressure forced him to begin the crackdowns that lead to the 'Semana Tragica', and the events that subsequently created the FOP.\n\n His increasing authoritarianism lead to factionalism in the UCR and the subsequent split of the UCRA, and when he was re-elected in 1938, where his antagonizing position against the army and the local elites caused the Uriburu's 1930 coup, where he was banned from politics. Now that he's president again, he'll finish the reforms that he started in 1928 and will try to bring about his uncle's vision of a strong and democratic Argentina."

He, like many other 'Gauchos' from rural areas, was forced to move to the big cities in search of work, more specifically to the city of Zarate in 1923. His first political experience was in 1927, when he signed up with the 'Sindicato de Frigorificos de Zarate', where he helped create the 'Federación Obreros de la Industria de la Carne' with other trade unions of Zarate and Berisso.\n\n When Uriburu came to power, he was sent to the Ushuaia penitentiary after organizing a succesful strike where he demanded the company 'River Plate de Zarate' to pay their worker's wages which had been delayed for two months. Now that he's free and in control of Argentina, he'll make sure to provide justice for the workers from the exploitation of the burgoisie."
POLITICS_ANGEL_BORLENGHI_DESC:0 "Angel Borlenghi was born in 1906 in the Argentinean capital, Buenos Aires City. He became involved in politics with the local socialists of Pompeya's neighbourhood at a very young age, joining the 'Gremio de Empleados de Comercio'('Trade Employees Syndicate') and the Socialist Party as soon as he came of age. Unlike the leadership within the Socialist Party, he liked to keep direct contact with the workers, which gained him a lot of support among the trade unions. Despite having an illustrious performance within the 'CGT' ('Central General del Trabajo'), he never managed to climb up the ranks within the Socialist Party.\n\n After Uriburu's coup and the subsequent crackdowns on anarchist, syndicalists and socialists, he was arrested and taken to the Ushuaia penitentiary. Now that he's free and sits within the 'Casa Rosada', He'll use his connections within the Trade Unions to lead Argentina to a better tomorrow with the worker's consent."
POLITICS_ARTURO_FRONDIZI_DESC:0 "Arturo Frondizi was born in 1908 in the border town of Paso de los Libres, Corrientes Province, Argentina. Frondizi was a strong supporter of the UCR and a defender of democracy when Yrigoyen managed to win the presidency, but refused to participate in any sort of political activity. However, Uriburu's coup forced him to change his point of view regarding democracy, where he even refused attending his own graduation ceremony which Uriburu would attend to give him an Honor Diploma in Law.\n\n He was arrested in a democratic demonstration in 1931. This very detention has made Frondizi decide to leave his work as a law professor and begin a career as a politician. At the end of 1932, he was arrested at another rally, and when he was released he joined the UCR.\n\n He has since then joined a faction within the UCR that considers the approach of Marcelo T. de Alvear to be too conservative, and he has made promises to bring more progressive reforms to Argentina and return to the economic policies Yrigoyen enacted. Now that he sits in the 'Casa Rosada', it remains to be seen if he'll be true to his word."

He afilliated the UCR and participated in the failed 1905 revolution. When the UCR split, he joined the UCRA and became public works minister for Marcelo T. de Alvear.\n\n Despite his support for the democratic process, he supported Uriburu's coup, although he despised Uriburu's economic policies. After the Carlés coup, Ortiz has become convinced that the political corruption in Argentina has to end once and for all if democracy is ever to survive in Argentina, and will endeavour all of his efforts from the 'Casa Rosada' to strengthen the democratic process and end local corruption, with intervention if needed."
POLITICS_EDELMIRO_FARRELL_DESC:0 "Edelmiro Farrel was born in 1887, in Avellaneda, Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Born to an Irish migrant family, he enroled in a military school and graduated in 1907. While no one doubts of his military ability and personal charisma, he was never prepared to be a politician. Now that the role of presidency has been thrusted upon him after overthrowing Ramirez, he has becomed a mere puppet of the GOU's control over the country. He relies mostly on his vice-president, Juan Domingo Peron, to do most of the political work, where Farrel only ever appears in public ceremonies and signs public documents in the name of the GOU."

Alvear became involved in politics at a young age, helping organize a meeting in Jardin Florida which would lead to the 'Revolución del Parque', after which he became secretary for Leandro N. Alem. He continued serving Alem until his suicide, after which he left to France for a time and got married. He was elected deputy between 1912 and 1916 without even residing in the country, forcing him to return to Argentina during the Sáenz Peña regime, after which he became Argentinean ambassador to France, even donating a large amount of wealth for the construction of frontline hospitals. Despite their defeat at the Great War, Alvear has presserved his pro-entente view, and that has led to clashes with UCR's ex-President Yrigoyen, who believes that Argentina should remain neutral in world affairs.\n\n He was elected as president from 1922 to 1928, where he became the first Argentinean President to be recorded on a radio. He tried to reduce the FOP's influence by granting better rights for workers in the country, although he kept a hardline stance towards the FOP, mostly due to militaristic influences in his staff. Like his predecessor, Yrigoyen, he tried to intervene provinces that had their elections rigged by wealthy local elites, but his methods polarized the UCR and the UCRA even more. Nevertheless, his progressive social, educational and economic reforms have left a positive impression in the Argentinean people, and now that he's been re-elected as president, he'll try to re-enact and continue the reforms for which he stood for in his first presidency."

His father died when he was very young, and he was forced to move to Argentina with his brother when he was just thirteen years old. Already as a teenager, he was exposed to the anarchist ideals by the people he met while he travelled with the 'Serrano-Mendoza' traveling theater company. He participated in a strike of trade employees in Trelew, Chubut province, that turned into an open rebellion, with him fightning alongside the strikers. Although the revolt was crushed, he gained valuable experience for his future uprising.\n\n When the second Patagonic strike came about, after wealthy landlords decided to ignore the requests that had been agreed between the strikers and the government, he decided to join up with the strikers and organize their insurrection. The strike led up to a stand-off at the 'La Anita' farm, where Soto rallied the disillusioned workers with a fiery speech and managed to hold back an army detachment lead by Lieutenant Colonel Varela. His forces began growing with simple workers who wanted better working conditions and eager idealists alike, and would later join up Alfredo Fonte's forces in 1923 in the events that lead to the creation of the FOP.

He joined up a group of young writers in Argentina and they all afilliated the Partido Socialista. However, the Partido Socialista's conservative leadership by Juan B. Justo quickly antagonized the young group, which formed it's own more combative faction within the PS.\n\n When the FOP broke off, Ugarte couldn't stand Justo's inaction, and decided to leave towards the newly-born nation. While Ugarte has shown devotion to the revolutionary ideals, he also has many differences with his fellow revolutionaries. He staunchly defends freedom of religion and the concept of nations, reaffirming his love for the Argentinean nation and culture. However, he also believes in joining forces with other socialists in order to stop imperialism into South America, and as such, he'll strive to unite America under his banner."

She began working in 1925 in a textile workshop when she was just fourteen years old, but would later drop off her job to become a music teacher. She then met journalist Eduardo Edelman, with whom she'd meet writers Leónidas Barletta and Álvaro Yunque, who convinced her to become a communist in 1934. Finding her new ideals now clashing with her life, she decided to go to the FOP with her husband. Her trip was long and hard, and they barely managed to cross the Rio Negro as the Argentinean Border Guard closed in on them. An FOP's border guard patrol that was passing by intervened, and Fanny survived the subsequent skirmish.\n\n Since then, she has joined up the border guard of the FOP in order to help other revolutionaries escape to the FOP and help protect it from reactionary aggression. She became an active member of the force, participating in plenty of border skirmishes between 1934 and 1936, which have granted her a lot of experience and popularity amongst the FOP's populace. Now that she leads the FOP, she'll use her military experience to fight off imperialism, and try to unite South America under the banner of internationalism."

A French nobleman, who inherited the self-proclaimed title of King of Araucania and Patagonia from his father, who rules over a population that is rather apathetic to him. While the Mapuches had agreed on a French king a few decades past, things have changed a lot since then.

During his first encounter with the strikers, he was lenient and allowed them to continue, considering the strikers were right in reclaiming better rights from their employers. However, during the second Patagonic strike, his ruthlessness shined through, as he demanded the strikers to surrender unconditionally, even executing the messengers Soto sent to reach an agreement. However, he failed to contain the uprising, and his failure gained him a demotion in the army. However, since then he has worked closely with the Liga Patriotica, gaining valuable experience in anti-insurgency tactics, and now that he's military governor of the Patagonia, he will rule with an iron fist and hunt down those who once dared to humiliate him"
POLITICS_FONTE_FOP_DESC:0 "Alfredo Fonte, better known as 'El Toscano', was the leader of a group of anarchist bandits which roamed the Patagonia, attacking isolated farms, homesteads and even villages back in 1921, at the time of the Second Patagonic Strike. He met up with Micaela Feldman de Echebéhère during those years, who taught him military strategy, and turned the brigand into a proper general. In 1923, he met up with Soto in Paso Ibañez, as the Patagonic uprising was growing out of control, where they both agreed to work together and settle their differences. Soto would lead the FOP, but Fonte would lead it's armies, in one of the events that marked the creation of the FOP. However, he hasn't abandoned his old ways, and was seen pillaging villages across the border several times. Now that he's in power, his psychotic and violent attitude and totalitarian views are bound to change the face of the FOP forever."

He graduated military school in 1906 and was sent to France to take part in their manoeuvring exercises. On his return to Perú in 1910, he became involved in the 'Campaña del Caqueta', which allowed him to climb through the ranks until becoming Chief of Staff in 1913. In 1914 he joined the coup against President Billinghurst, becoming provisional president until 1915, where he called for elections after securing stability. He was then sent to Europe as an observer during the Weltkrieg, but resigned his post when Leguía couped the democratic government.\n\n Leguía was quick to react to Benavidez return, imprisoning him and sending him along with other political prisoners to exile. However, Benavidez managed to organize a succesful mutiny in the ship that transported them, escaping to Central America, where he'd support Sanchez Cerro's uprising and later taking an important role in Sanchez Cerro's government.\n\n With Sanchez Cerro's death, Benavidez took advantage of the anarchy that ensued and became Cerro's successor, suspeding elections and becoming Perú's new Caudillo.

He became a teacher in that same university and would return to his educative role many times during his political career. He was named Minster of Justice, Cult and Instruction during President Leguía's first regime, and would become an active member of Peruvian politics until Leguia's coup in 1919. He was chosen as Principal for the San Marcos University, but rejected his position in protest of Leguia's takeover, and began writing three Manifestos, all of them praising the youthful fighting spirit of his students and warning of the danger that entailed having a Caudillo leading Perú. He was exiled in 1925, but would return in 1927, trying to stay away from politics. During Sanchez Cerro's government, he took part in the subsequent constitutional reforms, although he didn't defend some points that the new constitution brought up. Now that he's president of Perú, he'll take a pragmatic approach to the issues Perú faces, trying to compromise with the UR and focusing on investing in better services and education for the nation."
POLITICS_JOSE_DE_LA_RIVA_DESC:0 "Jose de la Riva Agüero y Osma was born in 1885 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. The grandson of the first Peruvian president, José de la Riva Agüero y Sanchez-Boquete, he graduated from the 'Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos' as a bachelor in literature, philosophy and law, and managed to get a PhD in jurisprudence in 1911. His first political move was to write an article critizing Leguía's government in that same year, for which he was arrested, triggering the first ever student protest in the history of Perú, which demanded Agüero's release. Agüero was released, where he became a teacher in San Marcos, but when Leguia took over the government in 1919, Agüero wrote a manifesto defending the constitutional order and left in a self-imposed exile towards Europe.\n\n That travel to Europe changed him, as he was forced to witness the European recovery from the Weltkrieg, as well as the Syndicalist uprisings. It's in these circumstances that he meets D'Annunzio and Italo Balbo, whose far-right philosophy began influencing the once liberal Agüero. He returns in 1927 to Peru, after Cerro deposed Leguia, and began working as a history professor at the 'Pontificia Universidad Catolica'. He at first saw in Cerro just another dictator, but a meeting he had with the Caudillo changed his mind, as his experience in Europe and relation with thinkers like D'Annunzio and Carlés quickly turned him into a friend and close advisor of Sanchez Cerro. Although the hispanist ideals Agüero had were too extreme for Cerro, he was named head of ministers. With Cerro's death, he became his legal succesor in the UR, although Benavides took over the real power upon his death. Now that Agüero is in power, he'll try to take Perú in a radical new direction and return the old glory of the Virreynato back to Perú"

In 1930 he became the Mayor of Lima, but resigned a year later after discrepancies regarding the autonomy of the city's Instruction ministry, and his differences regarding Benavides's Autocratic rule. He left to Ecuador in a self-imposed exile after death-threats towards his family from radical UR members, only to return after Benavides gave signs of wanting to restore democracy to Perú, where the contacts he had gained him a place in the Partido Socialdemocrata.

He joined with his brothers to the Partido Civil in 1914, where they helped in the coup d'etat that overthrew President Billinghurst. He would later become deputy for the Dos de Mayo province, but would be exiled with his brothers for opposing Leguia's regime.\n\n After the assassination of Sanchez Cerro, Benavides, who was a childhood friend of Jorge, recalled him from exile in order to help him in his rule. Jorge began a reform to free political prisoners and recall political exiles that were punished by Sanchez Cerro and Leguia's regimes. However, Ugarteche would be forced to resign due to internal pressure, and Jose de la Riva Agüero would take his place, reinstating the hard-line policies against detractors of the regime. Disillusioned with Benavides regime, he formed the Movimiento Democratico with the support of his brothers. Now that Jorge has managed to become President, his belief in the free-market and pro-entente leanings will surely lead to a liberalisation of the Peruvian economy, ushering in a new era of economic prosperity to the nation."

There he met Manuel Gonzalez Prada, whose anarchist thoughts influenced the young Raul. He joined several protests against the Leguia regime, which would decide to get rid of him by granting him a scholarship to France. However, this move would backfire on Leguia, as the revolutions in Europe would influence young Raul and his friend, Mariategui, towards Syndicalist ideals.\n\n He would go to Mexico in 1924, and with other Peruvian syndicalist exiles formed the 'Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana' or 'APRA'. The APRA would focus on pan-americanism (or as Raul liked to call it, 'Indo-Americanism') and fighting imperialism and the burgois oligarchy that had settled in the continent. He'd return to Perú in 1925, settling in the north of the country with his fellow Apristas. In 1929, Raul led the Trujillo takeover, when APRA forces took over the city and proclaimed a Trujillan commune that would be lead by Raul, and executing the local garrison. When the revolt was crushed, he managed to escape to Chile, where he'd join forces with Churata and González Prada in order to strengthen the APRA for a new revolution in 1931.\n\n Now that Raul Haya de la Torre leads Perú, he'll bring about his dream of a worker's utopia for Perú, whatever the cost may be."

He was exiled to Bolivia in 1917, but would return to Perú in 1925, joining up Mariategui in Moquegua as the first group of left-wing indigenist thinkers was formed. When Mariategui finally died in 1930 in Chile, Churata was appointed by his friend in his dying wishes as the leader of the 'Frente Tupacamarista'. In his new role as leader, he'd later gather in 1931 with Raul Haya de la Torre and Alfredo González Prada in order to form a United Front from which bring about the Peruvian revolution.

In 1919, Prada would become the intellectual leader of the newly formed 'Frente Armado Obrero', which would fight for better working rights in its most moderate form and for an outright revolution in it's more radical members. Seeing the violence this group generated in Lima, Leguia decided to send the military to supress the movement, ending the first Peruvian Syndicalist experiment. He then decided to retire from public life temporarily, gathering with other anarchists in Peru until the failed Trujillo rebellion forced him to go to Chile. There he joined forces in 1931 with Raúl Haya de la Torre and Gamaliel Churata with the goal of bringing the revolution to Perú.

He was freed after a decree by Sanchez Cerro, quickly gaining Flores's loyalty, who joined the Union Revolucionaria soon after. He accompanied Sanchez Cerro in his tour through Arequipa, Puno, Cusco and Ica, and would later become deputy for the UR. After the resign of Francisco Lanatta, Flores becomes the president of the council of ministers. During his time as president of the council, the crews of the Peruvian navy ships 'Almirante Grau' and 'Coronel Bolognesi' mutinied with apparent APRA influence. While Flores didn't believe the crews deserved the death penalty, the martial court determined they were traitors and had to die, so he came to the island of San Lorenzo with the prisoners, where he'd lead the execution personally. It is said that Flores himself forced each sailor to dig his own grave before being shot, earning him a reputation for cruelty in the UR.\n\n Flores became a close follower of Agüero, although he considered the latter to be too conservative in his approach against the APRA. Now that Flores is in power, he'll bring about his vision for a corporatist and totalitarian Perú, free from the influence of the decadent APRA which he'll hunt down relentlessly.

POLITICS_MUNAWAR_MUSSO_DESC:0 "Musso was one of the leaders of the revolutionaries in 1925, a revolution inspired by the British one which was swiftly crushed by the colonial authorities and eventually resulted in the destruction of the PKI, forcing Musso to flee to the People's Republic of Bengal, from where he got into touch with totalist thinkers from Europe. Convinced by the revolutionary ideas of this new movement, Musso hosted a reading and translation of the Totalist Charter among Insulindian exiles in Calcutta, subsequently forming the Partai Totalis Insulindia (PTI) that was to be the successor of the PKI. This definitively alienated Tan Malaka and his followers as the PTI rejected collaboration with muslims towards independence, setting the stage for a permanent split in Insulindian socialism."
POLITICS_SEMAUN_DESC:0 "While many other Insulindian independence leaders avoided deportation by the Dutch, a group of vocal trade unionists lead by Semaun were caught trying to organize a trade union meeting in Surabaya and deported to the Legation Cities. From this exile Semaun grew in power by drawing attention to the miserable working conditions in factories. As his trade union was becoming more and more popular with Malayan immigrants, distance support from Sarekat Islam dried up. The mantle to uphold trade unionism was picked up by agents of the Third internationale, who assisted Semaun in founding the PVI. Now, Semaun's dramatic return has brought new issues that intergrating with a political left that distrusts him."
POLITICS_WESTERLING_DESC:0 "Out of all the nations for Westerling to land in, Insulindia was his last choice, although he had adopted islam at a young age, his relations with Sarekat Islam and leftism couldn't be more worse. His unit in Insulindia was both famous and infamous for their discipline and lack of emotions in carrying out their tasks. In the utter chaos of strife that engulfed the nation. Westerling emerged as a very much foreign influence within the nation of many foreigners. That has given Westerling an sort of outsider edge that allowed him to crawl to the top of the heap. "

Under his leadership, the fledgling Princely Federation routed socialist invaders and internal fifth-columnists alike, and thus prevented a Dominionist attack. As the Federation has matured, however, difficulties have arisen regarding the very nature of the nation's government.

Renowned for his great collections of music and literature, and singular amongst Indian lords for his patronage of higher-learning, Krishna Raja Wadiyar yearns for enlightenment.

POLITICS_Gustaf_V_DESC:0 "Gustaf V Bernadotte was born in 1858 and was the crown-prince of Sweden and Norway from 1872. It is no wonder that he is a man of the old ways, as during his father's reign the King of Sweden acted both as head of state and head of government, with ministers held responsible only to him. However, just two years before Gustaf's ascension to the throne, in 1905 his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament.\n\nWhen Gustaf first took the throne in 1907 he also ended a Swedish tradition of roughly 700 years when he refused a coronation. As such, during his reign as a king, he never wore a crown. While at first ambivalent about the Swedish politicians he angered in February 1914, when the Swedish liberal government wanted to cut in military spending. After holding a speech condemning their actions, the liberal government stepped down and was replaced by civil servants appointed by Gustav himself. In the following 1917 elections the Liberals and Social democrats made heavy gains, but Gustaf still attempted installing a conservative government. However, they were unable to form a coalition and Gustaf realised he could no longer appoint governments of his own choosing. During the following reforms, he found himself forced to act upon his minister's advice, and not the other way around.\n\nHe is married to the sickly Queen Victoria of Baden, who is known to be wearing the pants in the Royal household, especially concerning the King's attempted influence in politics in general and the close relations to Germany in particular."
